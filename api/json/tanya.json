The basic idea of file\nuploads is actually quite simple.  It basically works like this:\n\nA <form> tag is marked with enctype=multipart/form-data\nand an <input type=file> is placed in that form.\nThe application accesses the file from the files\ndictionary on the request object.\nuse the save() method of the file to save\nthe file permanently somewhere on the filesystem.\n\n\nA Gentle Introduction\u00b6\nLet\u2019s start with a very basic application that uploads a file to a\nspecific upload folder and displays a file to the user.  Let\u2019s look at the\nbootstrapping code for our application:\nimport os\nfrom flask import Flask, flash, request, redirect, url_for\nfrom werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\n\nUPLOAD_FOLDER = '/path/to/the/uploads'\nALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'}\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = UPLOAD_FOLDER\n\n\nSo first we need a couple of imports.  Most should be straightforward, the\nwerkzeug.secure_filename() is explained a little bit later.  The\nUPLOAD_FOLDER is where we will store the uploaded files and the\nALLOWED_EXTENSIONS is the set of allowed file extensions.\nWhy do we limit the extensions that are allowed?  You probably don\u2019t want\nyour users to be able to upload everything there if the server is directly\nsending out the data to the client.  That way you can make sure that users\nare not able to upload HTML files that would cause XSS problems (see\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)).  Also make sure to disallow .php files if the server\nexecutes them, but who has PHP installed on their server, right?  :)\nNext the functions that check if an extension is valid and that uploads\nthe file and redirects the user to the URL for the uploaded file:\ndef allowed_file(filename):\n    return '.' in filename and \\\n           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef upload_file():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        # check if the post request has the file part\n        if 'file' not in request.files:\n            flash('No file part')\n            return redirect(request.url)\n        file = request.files['file']\n        # if user does not select file, browser also\n        # submit an empty part without filename\n        if file.filename == '':\n            flash('No selected file')\n            return redirect(request.url)\n        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):\n            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)\n            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))\n            return redirect(url_for('uploaded_file',\n                                    filename=filename))\n    return '''\n    <!doctype html>\n    <title>Upload new File</title>\n    <h1>Upload new File</h1>\n    <form method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>\n      <input type=file name=file>\n      <input type=submit value=Upload>\n    </form>\n    '''\n\n\nSo what does that secure_filename() function actually do?\nNow the problem is that there is that principle called \u201cnever trust user\ninput\u201d.  This is also true for the filename of an uploaded file.  All\nsubmitted form data can be forged, and filenames can be dangerous.  For\nthe moment just remember: always use that function to secure a filename\nbefore storing it directly on the filesystem.\n\nInformation for the Pros\nSo you\u2019re interested in what that secure_filename()\nfunction does and what the problem is if you\u2019re not using it?  So just\nimagine someone would send the following information as filename to\nyour application:\nfilename = \"../../../../home/username/.bashrc\"\n\n\nAssuming the number of ../ is correct and you would join this with\nthe UPLOAD_FOLDER the user might have the ability to modify a file on\nthe server\u2019s filesystem he or she should not modify.  This does require some\nknowledge about how the application looks like, but trust me, hackers\nare patient :)\nNow let\u2019s look how that function works:\n>>> secure_filename('../../../../home/username/.bashrc')\n'home_username_.bashrc'\n\n\n\nNow one last thing is missing: the serving of the uploaded files. In the\nupload_file() we redirect the user to\nurl_for('uploaded_file', filename=filename), that is, /uploads/filename.\nSo we write the uploaded_file() function to return the file of that name. As\nof Flask 0.5 we can use a function that does that for us:\nfrom flask import send_from_directory\n\n@app.route('/uploads/<filename>')\ndef uploaded_file(filename):\n    return send_from_directory(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'],\n                               filename)\n\n\nAlternatively you can register uploaded_file as build_only rule and\nuse the SharedDataMiddleware.  This also works with\nolder versions of Flask:\nfrom werkzeug.middleware.shared_data import SharedDataMiddleware\napp.add_url_rule('/uploads/<filename>', 'uploaded_file',\n                 build_only=True)\napp.wsgi_app = SharedDataMiddleware(app.wsgi_app, {\n    '/uploads':  app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']\n})\n\n\nIf you now run the application everything should work as expected.\n\n\nImproving Uploads\u00b6\n\nChangelog\nNew in version 0.6.\n\nSo how exactly does Flask handle uploads?  Well it will store them in the\nwebserver\u2019s memory if the files are reasonable small otherwise in a\ntemporary location (as returned by tempfile.gettempdir()).  But how\ndo you specify the maximum file size after which an upload is aborted?  By\ndefault Flask will happily accept file uploads to an unlimited amount of\nmemory, but you can limit that by setting the MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH\nconfig key:\nfrom flask import Flask, Request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024\n\n\nThe code above will limit the maximum allowed payload to 16 megabytes.\nIf a larger file is transmitted, Flask will raise a\nRequestEntityTooLarge exception.\n\nConnection Reset Issue\nWhen using the local development server, you may get a connection\nreset error instead of a 413 response. You will get the correct\nstatus response when running the app with a production WSGI server.\n\nThis feature was added in Flask 0.6 but can be achieved in older versions\nas well by subclassing the request object.  For more information on that\nconsult the Werkzeug documentation on file handling.\n\n\nUpload Progress Bars\u00b6\nA while ago many developers had the idea to read the incoming file in\nsmall chunks and store the upload progress in the database to be able to\npoll the progress with JavaScript from the client.  Long story short: the\nclient asks the server every 5 seconds how much it has transmitted\nalready.  Do you realize the irony?  The client is asking for something it\nshould already know.\n\n\nAn Easier Solution\u00b6\nNow there are better solutions that work faster and are more reliable. There\nare JavaScript libraries like jQuery that have form plugins to ease the\nconstruction of progress bar.\nBecause the common pattern for file uploads exists almost unchanged in all\napplications dealing with uploads, there is also a Flask extension called\nFlask-Uploads that implements a full fledged upload mechanism with white and\nblacklisting of extensions and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nUploading Files\nA Gentle Introduction\nImproving Uploads\nUpload Progress Bars\nAn Easier Solution\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nOverview\n\nPatterns for Flask\n\nPrevious: SQLAlchemy in Flask\nNext: Caching\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9 Copyright 2010 Pallets.\n      Created using Sphinx 2.2.2.\n    \n\n\n"},

Long story short: the client asks the server every 5 seconds\nhow much it has transmitted already. Do you realize the irony? The client is asking\nfor something it should already know.\nNow there are better solutions to that work faster and more reliable. The web changed\na lot lately and you can use HTML5, Java, Silverlight or Flash to get a nicer uploading\nexperience on the client side. Look at the following libraries for some nice examples\nhow to do that:\n\u2022\nPlupload\n- HTML5, Java, Flash\n\u2022\nSWFUpload\n- Flash\n\u2022\nJumpLoader\n- Java\n18.10.4 An Easier Solution\nBecause the common pattern for file uploads exists almost unchanged in all applica-\ntions dealing with uploads, there is a Flask extension called\nFlask-Uploads\nthat imple-\nments a full fledged upload mechanism with white and blacklisting of extensions and\nmore.\n18.11 Caching\nWhen your application runs slow, throw some caches in. Well, at least it\u2019s the easiest\nway to speed up things. What does a cache do? Say you have a function that takes\nsome time to complete but the results would still be good enough if they were 5 min-\nutes old. So then the idea is that you actually put the result of that calculation into a\ncache for some time.\nFlask itself does not provide caching for you, but Werkzeug, one of the libraries it is\nbased on, has some very basic cache support. It supports multiple cache backends,\nnormally you want to use a memcached server.\n18.11.1 Setting up a Cache\nYou create a cache object once and keep it around, similar to how\nFlask\nobjects are\ncreated. If you are using the development server you can create a\nSimpleCache\nobject,\nthat one is a simple cache that keeps the item stored in the memory of the Python\ninterpreter:\nfrom\nwerkzeug.contrib.cache\nimport\nSimpleCache\ncache\n=\nSimpleCache()\n128If you want to use memcached, make sure to have one of the memcache modules\nsupported (you get them from\nPyPI\n) and a memcached server running somewhere.\nThis is how you connect to such an memcached server then:\nfrom\nwerkzeug.contrib.cache\nimport\nMemcachedCache\ncache\n=\nMemcachedCache([\n\u2019127. . .1:11211\u2019\n])\nIf you are using App Engine, you can connect to the App Engine memcache server\neasily:\nfrom\nwerkzeug.contrib.cache\nimport\nGAEMemcachedCache\ncache\n=\nGAEMemcachedCache()\n18.11.2 Using a Cache\nNow how can one use such a cache? There are two very important operations:\nget()\nand\nset()\n. This is how to use them:\nTo get an item from the cache call\nget()\nwith a string as key name. If something is in\nthe cache, it is returned. Otherwise that function will return\nNone\n:\nrv\n=\ncache\n.\nget(\n\u2019my-item\u2019\n)\nTo add items to the cache, use the\nset()\nmethod instead. The first argument is the\nkey and the second the value that should be set.

I'd like to reject any file over a certain size. There are a few solutions floating around:\nFrom the docs:\n\nIn addition, you can also use patch_request_class to patch your app\u2019s request_class to have a maximum size for uploads. \n\npatch_request_class(app, 32 * 1024 * 1024)\n\nFrom this SO post:\n\nMAX_CONTENT_LENGTH is the correct way to reject file uploads larger than you want,\n\napp.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024\n\n# save to disk first, then check filesize\nrequest.files['file'].save('/tmp/foo')\nsize = os.stat('/tmp/foo').st_size\n\n-or- \n# save to memory, then check filesize\nblob = request.files['file'].read()\nsize = len(blob)\n\nI don't see MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH mentioned in the official docs, nor does it even manually check the filesize like the SO post does. Are these two methods ultimately the same, or does there exist a (big/subtle?) difference? Also, does patch_request_class save the file to disk first to determine total upload size, or does it save to memory?\n\n\n\n\npython file-upload flask flask-uploads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n|\nimprove this question\n|\n\r\n        follow\r\n    \n|\n\n\n\n\n\nedited May 23 '17 at 11:59\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity\u2666\n\n111 silver badge\n\n\n \n\n\n\r\n        asked Aug 7 '15 at 9:15\n\n\n\n\n\nrublexrublex\n\n1,71311 gold badge1919 silver badges4242 bronze badges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou accepted already! on check size limit. waste bandwith. stackoverflow.com/questions/1601455/\u2026\r\n                \r\n\u2013\u00a0dsgdfg\nAug 7 '15 at 9:49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd a comment\n\u00a0|\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        2 Answers\r\n                                    2\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            Active\n\r\n            Oldest\n\r\n            Votes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAX_CONTENT_LENGTH is a configuration item for Flask itself, introduced in version 0.6\nhttp://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/fileuploads/#improving-uploads\n\nBy default Flask will happily accept file uploads to an unlimited\n  amount of memory, but you can limit that by setting the\n  MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH config key:\nfrom flask import Flask, Request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024\n\nThe code above will limited the maximum allowed payload to 16\n  megabytes. If a larger file is transmitted, Flask will raise an\n  RequestEntityTooLarge exception.\nThis feature was added in Flask 0.6 but can be achieved in older\n  versions as well by subclassing the request object. For more\n  information on that consult the Werkzeug documentation on file\n  handling.\n\nAnd from the flask-uploads source:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-uploads/src/440e06b851d24811d20f8e06a8eaf5c5bf58c241/flaskext/uploads.py?at=default\n\ndef patch_request_class(app, size=64 * 1024 * 1024):\n    \"\"\"\n    By default, Flask will accept uploads to an arbitrary size. While Werkzeug\n    switches uploads from memory to a temporary file when they hit 500 KiB,\n    it's still possible for someone to overload your disk space with a\n    gigantic file.\n\n    This patches the app's request class's\n    `~werkzeug.BaseRequest.max_content_length` attribute so that any upload\n    larger than the given size is rejected with an HTTP error.\n\n    .. note::\n\n       In Flask 0.6, you can do this by setting the `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`\n       setting, without patching the request class. To emulate this behavior,\n       you can pass `None` as the size (you must pass it explicitly). That is\n       the best way to call this function, as it won't break the Flask 0.6\n       functionality if it exists.\n\n    .. versionchanged:: 0.1.1\n\n    :param app: The app to patch the request class of.\n    :param size: The maximum size to accept, in bytes. The default is 64 MiB.\n                 If it is `None`, the app's `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` configuration\n                 setting will be used to patch.\n    \"\"\"\n    if size is None:\n        if isinstance(app.request_class.__dict__['max_content_length'],\n                      property):\n            return\n        size = app.config.get('MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH')\n    reqclass = app.request_class\n    patched = type(reqclass.__name__, (reqclass,),\n                   {'max_content_length': size})\n    app.request_class = patched\n\n\nSo I'd say go with:\napp.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n|\nimprove this answer\n|\n\r\n        follow\r\n    \n|\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        answered Aug 7 '15 at 9:37\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe YoungJoe Young\n\n5,32633 gold badges2323 silver badges2424 bronze badges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nso patch_request_class is just for backwards compatibility?\r\n                \r\n\u2013\u00a0rublex\nAug 7 '15 at 9:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd a comment\n\u00a0|\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatch_request_class was just for backwards compatibility. \nFrom Flask 0.6 onwards you should use app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'].\nI recently took over as maintainer of the Flask-Uploads project, and one of the first things I did was remove the patch_request_class in this commit as it does nothing but add confusion for new projects.

These are the lowest-level tools for managing Python\npackages and are recommended if higher-level tools do not suit your needs.\n\nNote\nThis doc uses the term package to refer to a\nDistribution Package  which is different from an Import\nPackage that which is used to import modules in your Python source code.\n\n\nInstalling pip\u00b6\npip is the reference Python package manager. It\u2019s used to install and\nupdate packages. You\u2019ll need to make sure you have the latest version of pip\ninstalled.\n\nWindows\u00b6\nThe Python installers for Windows include pip. You should be able to access\npip using:\npy -m pip --version\npip 9.0.1 from c:\\python36\\lib\\site-packages (Python 3.6.1)\n\n\nYou can make sure that pip is up-to-date by running:\npy -m pip install --upgrade pip\n\n\n\n\nLinux and macOS\u00b6\nDebian and most other distributions include a python-pip package, if you\nwant to use the Linux distribution-provided versions of pip see\nInstalling pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers.\nYou can also install pip yourself to ensure you have the latest version. It\u2019s\nrecommended to use the system pip to bootstrap a user installation of pip:\npython3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip\n\n\nAfterwards, you should have the newest pip installed in your user site:\npython3 -m pip --version\npip 9.0.1 from $HOME/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling virtualenv\u00b6\n\nNote\nIf you are using Python 3.3 or newer, the venv module is\nthe preferred way to create and manage virtual environments.\nvenv is included in the Python standard library and requires no additional installation.\nIf you are using venv, you may skip this section.\n\nvirtualenv is used to manage Python packages for different projects.\nUsing virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally\nwhich could break system tools or other projects. You can install virtualenv\nusing pip.\nOn macOS and Linux:\npython3 -m pip install --user virtualenv\n\n\nOn Windows:\npy -m pip install --user virtualenv\n\n\n\n\nCreating a virtual environment\u00b6\nvenv (for Python 3) and virtualenv (for Python 2) allow\nyou to manage separate package installations for\ndifferent projects. They essentially allow you to create a \u201cvirtual\u201d isolated\nPython installation and install packages into that virtual installation. When\nyou switch projects, you can simply create a new virtual environment and not\nhave to worry about breaking the packages installed in the other environments.\nIt is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python\napplications.\nTo create a virtual environment, go to your project\u2019s directory and run\nvenv. If you are using Python 2, replace venv with virtualenv\nin the below commands.\nOn macOS and Linux:\npython3 -m venv env\n\n\nOn Windows:\npy -m venv env\n\n\nThe second argument is the location to create the virtual environment. Generally, you\ncan just create this in your project and call it env.\nvenv will create a virtual Python installation in the env folder.\n\nNote\nYou should exclude your virtual environment directory from your version\ncontrol system using .gitignore or similar.\n\n\n\nActivating a virtual environment\u00b6\nBefore you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you\u2019ll\nneed to activate it. Activating a virtual environment will put the\nvirtual environment-specific\npython and pip executables into your shell\u2019s PATH.\nOn macOS and Linux:\nsource env/bin/activate\n\n\nOn Windows:\n.\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n\n\nYou can confirm you\u2019re in the virtual environment by checking the location of your\nPython interpreter, it should point to the env directory.\nOn macOS and Linux:\nwhich python\n.../env/bin/python\n\n\nOn Windows:\nwhere python\n.../env/bin/python.exe\n\n\nAs long as your virtual environment is activated pip will install packages into that\nspecific environment and you\u2019ll be able to import and use packages in your\nPython application.\n\n\nLeaving the virtual environment\u00b6\nIf you want to switch projects or otherwise leave your virtual environment, simply run:\ndeactivate\n\n\nIf you want to re-enter the virtual environment just follow the same instructions above\nabout activating a virtual environment. There\u2019s no need to re-create the virtual environment.\n\n\nInstalling packages\u00b6\nNow that you\u2019re in your virtual environment you can install packages. Let\u2019s install the\nRequests library from the Python Package Index (PyPI):\npip install requests\n\n\npip should download requests and all of its dependencies and install them:\nCollecting requests\n  Using cached requests-2.18.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting chardet<3.1.0,>=3.0.2 (from requests)\n  Using cached chardet-3.0.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting urllib3<1.23,>=1.21.1 (from requests)\n  Using cached urllib3-1.22-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting certifi>=2017.4.17 (from requests)\n  Using cached certifi-2017.7.27.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting idna<2.7,>=2.5 (from requests)\n  Using cached idna-2.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nInstalling collected packages: chardet, urllib3, certifi, idna, requests\nSuccessfully installed certifi-2017.7.27.1 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.6 requests-2.18.4 urllib3-1.22\n\n\n\n\nInstalling specific versions\u00b6\npip allows you to specify which version of a package to install using\nversion specifiers. For example, to install\na specific version of requests:\npip install requests==2.18.4\n\n\nTo install the latest 2.x release of requests:\npip install requests>=2.0.0,<3.0.0\n\n\nTo install pre-release versions of packages, use the --pre flag:\npip install --pre requests\n\n\n\n\nInstalling extras\u00b6\nSome packages have optional extras. You can tell pip to install these by\nspecifying the extra in brackets:\npip install requests[security]\n\n\n\n\nInstalling from source\u00b6\npip can install a package directly from source, for example:\ncd google-auth\npip install .\n\n\nAdditionally, pip can install packages from source in development mode,\nmeaning that changes to the source directory will immediately affect the\ninstalled package without needing to re-install:\npip install --editable .\n\n\n\n\nInstalling from version control systems\u00b6\npip can install packages directly from their version control system. For\nexample, you can install directly from a git repository:\ngit+https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-auth-library-python.git#egg=google-auth\n\n\nFor more information on supported version control systems and syntax, see pip\u2019s\ndocumentation on VCS Support.\n\n\nInstalling from local archives\u00b6\nIf you have a local copy of a Distribution Package\u2019s archive (a zip,\nwheel, or tar file) you can install it directly with pip:\npip install requests-2.18.4.tar.gz\n\n\nIf you have a directory containing archives of multiple packages, you can tell\npip to look for packages there and not to use the\nPython Package Index (PyPI) at all:\npip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ requests\n\n\nThis is useful if you are installing packages on a system with limited\nconnectivity or if you want to strictly control the origin of distribution\npackages.\n\n\nUsing other package indexes\u00b6\nIf you want to download packages from a different index than the\nPython Package Index (PyPI), you can use the --index-url flag:\npip install --index-url http://index.example.com/simple/ SomeProject\n\n\nIf you want to allow packages from both the Python Package Index (PyPI)\nand a separate index, you can use the --extra-index-url flag instead:\npip install --extra-index-url http://index.example.com/simple/ SomeProject\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading packages\u00b6\npip can upgrade packages in-place using the --upgrade flag. For example, to\ninstall the latest version of requests and all of its dependencies:\npip install --upgrade requests\n\n\n\n\nUsing requirements files\u00b6\nInstead of installing packages individually, pip allows you to declare all\ndependencies in a Requirements File. For\nexample you could create a requirements.txt file containing:\nrequests==2.18.4\ngoogle-auth==1.1.0\n\n\nAnd tell pip to install all of the packages in this file using the -r flag:\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\nFreezing dependencies\u00b6\nPip can export a list of all installed packages and their versions using the\nfreeze command:\npip freeze\n\n\nWhich will output a list of package specifiers such as:\ncachetools==2.0.1\ncertifi==2017.7.27.1\nchardet==3.0.4\ngoogle-auth==1.1.1\nidna==2.6\npyasn1==0.3.6\npyasn1-modules==0.1.4\nrequests==2.18.4\nrsa==3.4.2\nsix==1.11.0\nurllib3==1.22\n\n\nThis is useful for creating Requirements Files that can re-create\nthe exact versions of all packages installed in an environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAn Overview of Packaging for Python\nTutorials\nGuides\nInstalling packages using pip and virtual environments\nInstalling stand alone command line tools\nInstalling pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers\nInstalling scientific packages\nMulti-version installs\nPackage index mirrors and caches\nHosting your own simple repository\nPackaging and distributing projects\nIncluding files in source distributions with MANIFEST.in\nSingle-sourcing the package version\nSupporting multiple Python versions\nDropping support for older Python versions\nPackaging binary extensions\nSupporting Windows using Appveyor\nPackaging namespace packages\nCreating and discovering plugins\nMigrating to PyPI.org\nUsing TestPyPI\nMaking a PyPI-friendly README\nPublishing package distribution releases using GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows\nTool recommendations\nAnalyzing PyPI package downloads\n\n\nDiscussions\nPyPA specifications\nProject Summaries\nGlossary\nHow to Get Support\nContribute to this guide\nNews\n\nPrevious topic\nGuides\nNext topic\nInstalling stand alone command line tools\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nindex\n\nnext |\n\nprevious |\n\nPyPA \u00bb\nPython Packaging User Guide \u00bb\n    \n\n          Guides \u00bb\nInstalling packages using pip and virtual environments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         |\n    \n\n\n\n    \u00a9 Copyright 2013\u20132020, PyPA.\n    \n    This page is licensed under the Python Software Foundation License Version 2.\n    \n    Examples, recipes, and other code in the documentation are additionally licensed under the Zero Clause BSD License.\n    \n    See History and License for more information.\n    \n\n    The Python Software Foundation is a non-profit corporation.\nPlease donate.\n\n\n\n    Last updated on Dec 15, 2020.\n    Found a bug?\n    \n\n    Created using Sphinx 3.2.0.\n    \n"},
{"text": "Sign inWhat is Ember.js?EditorFollowJul 9, 2019 \u00b7 8 min readEmber.js is a MVC (Model-View-Controller) JavaScript framework used to develop large client-side web applications. In comparison to other JavaScript MVC frameworks, it gives you the ability to write organized and structured code. According to the Ember.js website, this enables you to build \u201cambitious\u201d web applications.In Ember.js, route is used as a model, handlebar template as views and controllers manipulate the data in the model.If you want to build a single-page web application that pushes the envelope of what\u2019s possible on the web, Ember.js is the right choice for you.Figure 1.0 The structure of the early web (left) versus the promise of Ajax (middle) versus modern web applicationEarly websites were relying on the full-page refresh approach shown at the left in figure 1.0. With the arrival of the asynchronous call came the ability to send specific parts of the website for each response, as shown in figure 1.0 (middle).In Ember.js, the user receives the full website once, upon the initial request. So it increased initial load time but significantly improved performance for each subsequent user action, as shown in figure 1.0 (right).Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of the MVC components.\u00b7 Controller layer \u2014 Built with a combination of routes and controllers\u00b7 View layer \u2014 Built with a combination of templates and views\u00b7 Model layer \u2014 Built with a combination of model and ember data.Figure 2.0 The parts that make up Ember.js and how they fit in with the MVC patternModels and Ember DataThis layer is responsible for any server-side communication as well as model-specific tasks such as data formatting.Ember model uses ember data to dramatically simplify your code while improving the robustness and performance of the application.Controllers and the Ember RouterThe layer between the model and view is the controller layer. There are a couple of controllers, most notably the \u201cEmber.ObjectController\u201d and \u201cEmber.ArrayController\u201d.The Ember Router is the mechanism that updates your application URLs and listens to URL changes. Each route can have a number of sub-routes, and you can use the router to navigate between the states in your application.Views and Handlebars.JSThe view layer is responsible for drawing the elements on the screen. Ember.js has a sophisticated system for creating, managing and rendering a hierarchy of views that connect to the browser\u2019s DOM. Views are responsible for responding to user events, like clicks, drags, and scrolls, as well as updating the contents of the DOM when the data underlying the view changes.Ember.js uses Handlebars.js as its template engine. Handlebars.js provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.Ember.js is most likely Convention over Configuration. This means that instead of writing a lot of boilerplate code, Ember can automatically deduce much of the configuration itself, such as automatically deciding the name of the route and the controller when defining a router resource. Ember even increases the bar by automatically creating the controller for your resource if you never define it specifically.Ember includes both an excellent router and an optional data layer, called ember data. Unlike AngularJS and BackboneJS frameworks, which have a very minimal data layer (Backbone\u2019s Collection/Model and Angular\u2019s $resource), Ember comes out of the box with a full data module which integrates really nicely with a Ruby-on-Rails back-end or any other RESTful JSON API that follows a simple set of conventions. It also provides support for setting up fixtures for developing against mock API and testing.When it comes to the design of Ember.js, performance has been a major goal. Concepts such as The Run Loop, which ensures that updated data only causes a single DOM update even if the same piece of data was updated several times, along with caching of computed properties, and the ability to precompile the HandleBars templates during the build time or on your server, help to load and keep your application running fast.AngularJS and EmberJSAngularJS and EmberJS are similar frameworks on a number of levels, but also different in several elements. AngularJS, for example, will display a large static data set more quickly than EmberJS, but EmberJS will make it easier to add interactivity to that large data set and will handle changes more efficiently. Furthermore, while both are opinionated frameworks, EmberJS takes a somewhat stronger position than AngularJS, which can make some tasks around porting an existing application challenging to complete. In the end, either architecture has its own trade-offs, and determining which framework is right for you is simply a matter of evaluating your application\u2019s needs versus the strengths of each framework.Best practices for real world Ember deployment\u201cEmber CLI\u201d is a command line tool for quickly generating web apps structure. The CLI is a very useful tool and will probably be the standard way to create ember apps in the future. Using Ember CLI slightly changes the way the app is written.How to use Ember-CLI?First, you have to download and install \u201cnode.js\u201d to your computer.Once you have node installed, you can get ember-CLI by opening up a command prompt and running:$ npm install -g ember-cliTo create a structure for the application you can run:$ ember new project-nameThis will create a folder called releases with everything needed to start coding. Change the current directory into releases and run:$ ember serverNow you should be able to visit \u201chttp://localhost:4200\u201d and see a very basic page.Is The Three Test Values Sufficient Enough To Perform A Black Box Test At All Times?The Boundary Value Analysis is a popular test technique. It is easy to understand and easy to explain to the testers and the non-testers alike. Part of the ease in comprehension is based on the elegant and simple examples that can be used to explain the technique. A boundary value is introduced, and it\u2019s explained that the three values are needed to test the boundaries thoroughly. But this article tries to show that three values are not enough to perform a black box test to prove that a boundary has been implemented correctly.First of all let\u2019s find out what is meant by Equivalence Partitioning (EP). The basic idea of EP is quite simple. If you expect the same result from two tests, it\u2019s sufficient to run one of them. But this idea is based on two assumptions.1. Every test input can be divided into several classes.2. System processes every possible input value in a class exactly the same way as it process every other input value in the class.(Note that test outputs also can be considered the same as above)For an example: A bank system accepts clients aged 55 years old or younger. All other potential clients are not accepted. Ages are entered into the system under test in whole years.Considering above example, we can divide two possible classes as follows:1. Clients aged 55 and younger will be accepted (we call this class as valid class)2. Clients aged 56 and older will be rejected (we call this class as invalid class)When using EP for above example we can test the system with following test values.1. 15 to represent valid class2. 75 to represent invalid classNote that the above values are chosen arbitrarily due to the assumptions we make on EP technique. Also the values 20 and 80, or 40 and 65 could have been chosen.Let\u2019s find out what is Boundary Value Analysis (BVA). While testing, it was discovered that some defects seemed to cluster around values outline the equivalence classes (boundaries). The boundaries are being incorporated into programming code during programming. In the example above, focusing on the \u201cyounger than or equal to 55 years old\u201d boundary, code can say as \u201cIF age <= 55\u201d.Since this boundary is code, this is where programming error most likely could occur. In Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) test technique this means to test with test values on, just below, and just above the boundary to detect any possible programming fault made in rational operator (<, <=, =, >, >=, <>). The defect could exist regarding the rational operator programming faults in the <= sign. This operator could wrongly be programmed as >, >=, = , <, <> or = instead of <=. Let\u2019s check whether operator fault can be found using three values considering BVA.In Summary, the use of BVA comes down as follow:1. Identify equivalence classes.2. Determine Boundary Values.3. Specify test cases using three values for each boundary.But BVA is often used in black box testing and test professional has no insight into the implementation of the functional design above example also can be coded as \u201cIF age < 56\u201d. If so, let\u2019s find out same three values enough to detect the fault.As shown in the table above, if \u201c<> 56\u201d was (wrongly) programmed instead of the intended \u201c< 56\u201d, the actual results and the expected results are identical for all three BVA test cases. Therefore, the fault will not be detected for the black box testing.As a remedy, we can follow the following steps to find out another suitable test value to detect the fault.Identify the equivalence classes.According to the example, IF Age <= 55 is valid class. (Age < 56) IF Age > 55 is invalid class. Get closest value for the boundary value from each valid and invalid class. From Valid EP (55) From Invalid EP (56) Get the next nearest value for selected values in step#2. From Valid EP (54) From Invalid EP(57) Specify test cases, using four test values per boundary.Let\u2019s apply identified test values for the example.By adding the extra test value (57) the fault (\u201c<>\u201d being programmed instead of \u201c<\u201d) will, even when using Boundary Value analysis as a black box technique, be found.Summary & Conclusion:When we perform BB testing using EP and BVA techniques, we are use only the three test values and I have proved that we could have miss some failures. To avoid and increase the probability of error detection, we could have used the four test values, which are taken from each valid EP and invalid EP closest to the boundary value.Rule of Thumb:Four test values are chosen:\u00b7 Two values from the valid EP, which are closest to the boundary value,\u00b7 Two values from the invalid EP, which are closest to the boundary value,AeturnumAeturnum is a software services organization based in\u2026Follow11 JavaScript11\u00a0claps11\u00a0clapsWritten byEditorFollowFollowAeturnumFollowAeturnum is a software services organization based in Boston, USAFollowWritten byEditorFollowAeturnumFollowAeturnum is a software services organization based in Boston, USAMore From MediumMicro and Macro tasks in JavaScriptMichael PautovCreating CSV and ZIP files With Node.jsMatthew Croak in Better ProgrammingBuild React Tabs Using Recoil, Styled Components, and Storybook.jsJennifer Fu in Better ProgrammingBuilding HIPAA Compliant End-to-End Encrypted Chat with Stream React Chat and Virgil SecurityNick Parsons in Better ProgrammingHow to get TypeScript type completion by defining process.env typesAndr\u00e9as Hanss in JavaScript In Plain English5 Ways to Convert a Value to String in JavaScriptSamantha Ming in DailyJSWhy your company should start using Vue.jsRobert WadeHow to Integrate Card Payment with Stripe into Your Web App without Back-endYingying Fu in JavaScript In Plain EnglishLearn more.Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.\n                        Here, expert and undiscovered voices alike dive into the heart of any topic and bring new ideas to the surface.

{"text": "\n\nNavigation\n\n\nindex\n\nmodules |\n\nnext |\n\nprevious |\nFlask Documentation (1.1.x) \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading to Newer Releases\u00b6\nFlask itself is changing like any software is changing over time.  Most of\nthe changes are the nice kind, the kind where you don\u2019t have to change\nanything in your code to profit from a new release.\nHowever every once in a while there are changes that do require some\nchanges in your code or there are changes that make it possible for you to\nimprove your own code quality by taking advantage of new features in\nFlask.\nThis section of the documentation enumerates all the changes in Flask from\nrelease to release and how you can change your code to have a painless\nupdating experience.\nUse the pip command to upgrade your existing Flask installation by\nproviding the --upgrade parameter:\n$ pip install --upgrade Flask\n\n\n\nVersion 0.12\u00b6\n\nChanges to send_file\u00b6\nThe filename is no longer automatically inferred from file-like objects.\nThis means that the following code will no longer automatically have\nX-Sendfile support, etag generation or MIME-type guessing:\nresponse = send_file(open('/path/to/file.txt'))\n\n\nAny of the following is functionally equivalent:\nfname = '/path/to/file.txt'\n\n# Just pass the filepath directly\nresponse = send_file(fname)\n\n# Set the MIME-type and ETag explicitly\nresponse = send_file(open(fname), mimetype='text/plain')\nresponse.set_etag(...)\n\n# Set `attachment_filename` for MIME-type guessing\n# ETag still needs to be manually set\nresponse = send_file(open(fname), attachment_filename=fname)\nresponse.set_etag(...)\n\n\nThe reason for this is that some file-like objects have an invalid or even\nmisleading name attribute. Silently swallowing errors in such cases was not\na satisfying solution.\nAdditionally the default of falling back to application/octet-stream has\nbeen restricted. If Flask can\u2019t guess one or the user didn\u2019t provide one, the\nfunction fails if no filename information was provided.\n\n\n\nVersion 0.11\u00b6\n0.11 is an odd release in the Flask release cycle because it was supposed\nto be the 1.0 release.  However because there was such a long lead time up\nto the release we decided to push out a 0.11 release first with some\nchanges removed to make the transition easier.  If you have been tracking\nthe master branch which was 1.0 you might see some unexpected changes.\nIn case you did track the master branch you will notice that\nflask --app is removed now.\nYou need to use the environment variable to specify an application.\n\nDebugging\u00b6\nFlask 0.11 removed the debug_log_format attribute from Flask\napplications.  Instead the new LOGGER_HANDLER_POLICY configuration can\nbe used to disable the default log handlers and custom log handlers can be\nset up.\n\n\nError handling\u00b6\nThe behavior of error handlers was changed.\nThe precedence of handlers used to be based on the decoration/call order of\nerrorhandler() and\nregister_error_handler(), respectively.\nNow the inheritance hierarchy takes precedence and handlers for more\nspecific exception classes are executed instead of more general ones.\nSee Error handlers for specifics.\nTrying to register a handler on an instance now raises ValueError.\n\nNote\nThere used to be a logic error allowing you to register handlers\nonly for exception instances. This was unintended and plain wrong,\nand therefore was replaced with the intended behavior of registering\nhandlers only using exception classes and HTTP error codes.\n\n\n\nTemplating\u00b6\nThe render_template_string() function has changed to\nautoescape template variables by default. This better matches the behavior\nof render_template().\n\n\nExtension imports\u00b6\nExtension imports of the form flask.ext.foo are deprecated, you should use\nflask_foo.\nThe old form still works, but Flask will issue a\nflask.exthook.ExtDeprecationWarning for each extension you import the old\nway. We also provide a migration utility called flask-ext-migrate that is supposed to\nautomatically rewrite your imports for this.\n\n\n\nVersion 0.10\u00b6\nThe biggest change going from 0.9 to 0.10 is that the cookie serialization\nformat changed from pickle to a specialized JSON format.  This change has\nbeen done in order to avoid the damage an attacker can do if the secret\nkey is leaked.  When you upgrade you will notice two major changes: all\nsessions that were issued before the upgrade are invalidated and you can\nonly store a limited amount of types in the session.  The new sessions are\nby design much more restricted to only allow JSON with a few small\nextensions for tuples and strings with HTML markup.\nIn order to not break people\u2019s sessions it is possible to continue using\nthe old session system by using the Flask-OldSessions extension.\nFlask also started storing the flask.g object on the application\ncontext instead of the request context.  This change should be transparent\nfor you but it means that you now can store things on the g object\nwhen there is no request context yet but an application context.  The old\nflask.Flask.request_globals_class attribute was renamed to\nflask.Flask.app_ctx_globals_class.\n\n\nVersion 0.9\u00b6\nThe behavior of returning tuples from a function was simplified.  If you\nreturn a tuple it no longer defines the arguments for the response object\nyou\u2019re creating, it\u2019s now always a tuple in the form (response, status,\nheaders) where at least one item has to be provided.  If you depend on\nthe old behavior, you can add it easily by subclassing Flask:\nclass TraditionalFlask(Flask):\n    def make_response(self, rv):\n        if isinstance(rv, tuple):\n            return self.response_class(*rv)\n        return Flask.make_response(self, rv)\n\n\nIf you maintain an extension that was using _request_ctx_stack\nbefore, please consider changing to _app_ctx_stack if it makes\nsense for your extension.  For instance, the app context stack makes sense for\nextensions which connect to databases.  Using the app context stack instead of\nthe request context stack will make extensions more readily handle use cases\noutside of requests.\n\n\nVersion 0.8\u00b6\nFlask introduced a new session interface system.  We also noticed that\nthere was a naming collision between flask.session the module that\nimplements sessions and flask.session which is the global session\nobject.  With that introduction we moved the implementation details for\nthe session system into a new module called flask.sessions.  If you\nused the previously undocumented session support we urge you to upgrade.\nIf invalid JSON data was submitted Flask will now raise a\nBadRequest exception instead of letting the\ndefault ValueError bubble up.  This has the advantage that you no\nlonger have to handle that error to avoid an internal server error showing\nup for the user.  If you were catching this down explicitly in the past\nas ValueError you will need to change this.\nDue to a bug in the test client Flask 0.7 did not trigger teardown\nhandlers when the test client was used in a with statement.  This was\nsince fixed but might require some changes in your test suites if you\nrelied on this behavior.\n\n\nVersion 0.7\u00b6\nIn Flask 0.7 we cleaned up the code base internally a lot and did some\nbackwards incompatible changes that make it easier to implement larger\napplications with Flask.  Because we want to make upgrading as easy as\npossible we tried to counter the problems arising from these changes by\nproviding a script that can ease the transition.\nThe script scans your whole application and generates a unified diff with\nchanges it assumes are safe to apply.  However as this is an automated\ntool it won\u2019t be able to find all use cases and it might miss some.  We\ninternally spread a lot of deprecation warnings all over the place to make\nit easy to find pieces of code that it was unable to upgrade.\nWe strongly recommend that you hand review the generated patchfile and\nonly apply the chunks that look good.\nIf you are using git as version control system for your project we\nrecommend applying the patch with path -p1 < patchfile.diff and then\nusing the interactive commit feature to only apply the chunks that look\ngood.\nTo apply the upgrade script do the following:\n\nDownload the script: flask-07-upgrade.py\nRun it in the directory of your application:\n$ python flask-07-upgrade.py > patchfile.diff\n\n\n\nReview the generated patchfile.\nApply the patch:\n$ patch -p1 < patchfile.diff\n\n\n\nIf you were using per-module template folders you need to move some\ntemplates around.  Previously if you had a folder named templates\nnext to a blueprint named admin the implicit template path\nautomatically was admin/index.html for a template file called\ntemplates/index.html.  This no longer is the case.  Now you need\nto name the template templates/admin/index.html.  The tool will\nnot detect this so you will have to do that on your own.\n\nPlease note that deprecation warnings are disabled by default starting\nwith Python 2.7.  In order to see the deprecation warnings that might be\nemitted you have to enabled them with the warnings module.\nIf you are working with windows and you lack the patch command line\nutility you can get it as part of various Unix runtime environments for\nwindows including cygwin, msysgit or ming32.  Also source control systems\nlike svn, hg or git have builtin support for applying unified diffs as\ngenerated by the tool.  Check the manual of your version control system\nfor more information.\n\nBug in Request Locals\u00b6\nDue to a bug in earlier implementations the request local proxies now\nraise a RuntimeError instead of an AttributeError when they\nare unbound.  If you caught these exceptions with AttributeError\nbefore, you should catch them with RuntimeError now.\nAdditionally the send_file() function is now issuing\ndeprecation warnings if you depend on functionality that will be removed\nin Flask 0.11.  Previously it was possible to use etags and mimetypes\nwhen file objects were passed.  This was unreliable and caused issues\nfor a few setups.  If you get a deprecation warning, make sure to\nupdate your application to work with either filenames there or disable\netag attaching and attach them yourself.\nOld code:\nreturn send_file(my_file_object)\nreturn send_file(my_file_object)\n\n\nNew code:\nreturn send_file(my_file_object, add_etags=False)\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading to new Teardown Handling\u00b6\nWe streamlined the behavior of the callbacks for request handling.  For\nthings that modify the response the after_request()\ndecorators continue to work as expected, but for things that absolutely\nmust happen at the end of request we introduced the new\nteardown_request() decorator.  Unfortunately that\nchange also made after-request work differently under error conditions.\nIt\u2019s not consistently skipped if exceptions happen whereas previously it\nmight have been called twice to ensure it is executed at the end of the\nrequest.\nIf you have database connection code that looks like this:\n@app.after_request\ndef after_request(response):\n    g.db.close()\n    return response\n\n\nYou are now encouraged to use this instead:\n@app.teardown_request\ndef after_request(exception):\n    if hasattr(g, 'db'):\n        g.db.close()\n\n\nOn the upside this change greatly improves the internal code flow and\nmakes it easier to customize the dispatching and error handling.  This\nmakes it now a lot easier to write unit tests as you can prevent closing\ndown of database connections for a while.  You can take advantage of the\nfact that the teardown callbacks are called when the response context is\nremoved from the stack so a test can query the database after request\nhandling:\nwith app.test_client() as client:\n    resp = client.get('/')\n    # g.db is still bound if there is such a thing\n\n# and here it's gone\n\n\n\n\nManual Error Handler Attaching\u00b6\nWhile it is still possible to attach error handlers to\nFlask.error_handlers it\u2019s discouraged to do so and in fact\ndeprecated.  In general we no longer recommend custom error handler\nattaching via assignments to the underlying dictionary due to the more\ncomplex internal handling to support arbitrary exception classes and\nblueprints.  See Flask.errorhandler() for more information.\nThe proper upgrade is to change this:\napp.error_handlers[403] = handle_error\n\n\nInto this:\napp.register_error_handler(403, handle_error)\n\n\nAlternatively you should just attach the function with a decorator:\n@app.errorhandler(403)\ndef handle_error(e):\n    ...\n\n\n(Note that register_error_handler() is new in Flask 0.7)\n\n\nBlueprint Support\u00b6\nBlueprints replace the previous concept of \u201cModules\u201d in Flask.  They\nprovide better semantics for various features and work better with large\napplications.  The update script provided should be able to upgrade your\napplications automatically, but there might be some cases where it fails\nto upgrade.  What changed?\n\nBlueprints need explicit names.  Modules had an automatic name\nguessing scheme where the shortname for the module was taken from the\nlast part of the import module.  The upgrade script tries to guess\nthat name but it might fail as this information could change at\nruntime.\nBlueprints have an inverse behavior for url_for().  Previously\n.foo told url_for() that it should look for the endpoint\nfoo on the application.  Now it means \u201crelative to current module\u201d.\nThe script will inverse all calls to url_for() automatically for\nyou.  It will do this in a very eager way so you might end up with\nsome unnecessary leading dots in your code if you\u2019re not using\nmodules.\nBlueprints do not automatically provide static folders.  They will\nalso no longer automatically export templates from a folder called\ntemplates next to their location however but it can be enabled from\nthe constructor.  Same with static files: if you want to continue\nserving static files you need to tell the constructor explicitly the\npath to the static folder (which can be relative to the blueprint\u2019s\nmodule path).\nRendering templates was simplified.  Now the blueprints can provide\ntemplate folders which are added to a general template searchpath.\nThis means that you need to add another subfolder with the blueprint\u2019s\nname into that folder if you want blueprintname/template.html as\nthe template name.\n\nIf you continue to use the Module object which is deprecated, Flask will\nrestore the previous behavior as good as possible.  However we strongly\nrecommend upgrading to the new blueprints as they provide a lot of useful\nimprovement such as the ability to attach a blueprint multiple times,\nblueprint specific error handlers and a lot more.\n\n\n\nVersion 0.6\u00b6\nFlask 0.6 comes with a backwards incompatible change which affects the\norder of after-request handlers.  Previously they were called in the order\nof the registration, now they are called in reverse order.  This change\nwas made so that Flask behaves more like people expected it to work and\nhow other systems handle request pre- and post-processing.  If you\ndepend on the order of execution of post-request functions, be sure to\nchange the order.\nAnother change that breaks backwards compatibility is that context\nprocessors will no longer override values passed directly to the template\nrendering function.  If for example request is as variable passed\ndirectly to the template, the default context processor will not override\nit with the current request object.  This makes it easier to extend\ncontext processors later to inject additional variables without breaking\nexisting template not expecting them.\n\n\nVersion 0.5\u00b6\nFlask 0.5 is the first release that comes as a Python package instead of a\nsingle module.  There were a couple of internal refactoring so if you\ndepend on undocumented internal details you probably have to adapt the\nimports.\nThe following changes may be relevant to your application:\n\nautoescaping no longer happens for all templates.  Instead it is\nconfigured to only happen on files ending with .html, .htm,\n.xml and .xhtml.  If you have templates with different\nextensions you should override the\nselect_jinja_autoescape() method.\nFlask no longer supports zipped applications in this release.  This\nfunctionality might come back in future releases if there is demand\nfor this feature.  Removing support for this makes the Flask internal\ncode easier to understand and fixes a couple of small issues that make\ndebugging harder than necessary.\nThe create_jinja_loader function is gone.  If you want to customize\nthe Jinja loader now, use the\ncreate_jinja_environment() method instead.\n\n\n\nVersion 0.4\u00b6\nFor application developers there are no changes that require changes in\nyour code.  In case you are developing on a Flask extension however, and\nthat extension has a unittest-mode you might want to link the activation\nof that mode to the new TESTING flag.\n\n\nVersion 0.3\u00b6\nFlask 0.3 introduces configuration support and logging as well as\ncategories for flashing messages.  All these are features that are 100%\nbackwards compatible but you might want to take advantage of them.\n\nConfiguration Support\u00b6\nThe configuration support makes it easier to write any kind of application\nthat requires some sort of configuration.  (Which most likely is the case\nfor any application out there).\nIf you previously had code like this:\napp.debug = DEBUG\napp.secret_key = SECRET_KEY\n\n\nYou no longer have to do that, instead you can just load a configuration\ninto the config object.  How this works is outlined in Configuration Handling.\n\n\nLogging Integration\u00b6\nFlask now configures a logger for you with some basic and useful defaults.\nIf you run your application in production and want to profit from\nautomatic error logging, you might be interested in attaching a proper log\nhandler.  Also you can start logging warnings and errors into the logger\nwhen appropriately.  For more information on that, read\nApplication Errors.\n\n\nCategories for Flash Messages\u00b6\nFlash messages can now have categories attached.  This makes it possible\nto render errors, warnings or regular messages differently for example.\nThis is an opt-in feature because it requires some rethinking in the code.\nRead all about that in the Message Flashing pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nUpgrading to Newer Releases\nVersion 0.12\nChanges to send_file\n\n\nVersion 0.11\nDebugging\nError handling\nTemplating\nExtension imports\n\n\nVersion 0.10\nVersion 0.9\nVersion 0.8\nVersion 0.7\nBug in Request Locals\nUpgrading to new Teardown Handling\nManual Error Handler Attaching\nBlueprint Support\n\n\nVersion 0.6\nVersion 0.5\nVersion 0.4\nVersion 0.3\nConfiguration Support\nLogging Integration\nCategories for Flash Messages\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nOverview\n\nPrevious: Pocoo Styleguide\nNext: Changelog\n\n\n\n\nQuick search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a9 Copyright 2010 Pallets.\n      Created using Sphinx 2.2.2.\n    \n\n\n"},

It feels like you\u2019re drowning, and the entire project is sinking along with you. This is called project scope creep.\nIn the midst of your despair, there\u2019s good news: you can stop it.\nMost of the time, these feelings come from a sneaky little thing called scope creep. I can\u2019t even begin to count the times it\u2019s happened to me. And if you\u2019re reading this article, then I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one.\nToday, I\u2019m going to share five scripts that I\u2019ve developed while struggling with scope creep. I\u2019ve found that they\u2019re very effective when explaining the situation to clients.\n1. Stay Vigilant from Day One\nYou\u2019ve gotta learn how to outsmart scope creep.\nAs a project manager, I\u2019ve got to handle scope creep at every turn. It requires saying yes or no as soon as a request comes in. Getting into this habit can feel pretty daunting at first.\nIn my freelancing days, scope creep really creeped me out. I\u2019d just take on the bit of extra work in fear of losing the client if I said no. That\u2019s a dangerous game to play, trust me. You\u2019ll end up overworked by trying to accommodate dozens of small tasks that add up to a monstrous headache.\nNext time a client sends a request and you need to say no, use this script:\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not able to add in that feature/component/service based on the scope of this project. Would you like to setup a time to discuss expanding our project scope and budget to accommodate this new feature?\u201d\n2. Offer Logical Solutions to the Problem\nI\u2019ve found that scope creep rarely happens in huge leaps. It\u2019s the little requests here and there that add up. And clients will keep making requests until you say no. Can you really blame them? Who wouldn\u2019t want to get every ounce of work they can for the money?\nThat\u2019s why project management requires such diligence.\nIf you\u2019re diligent, it may mean that you find yourself saying no more than you\u2019d like. And if you\u2019re anything like me, you hate saying no.\nSo, instead of a downright refusal, I oftentimes take a roundabout approach to scope creep. The approach looks something like this:\n\u201cOur current agreement is for [current terms] at [agreed cost]. From what you shared, you\u2019d like to add [scope creep request]\u2026 I\u2019d be willing to do that for [new cost based on additional request]. Or if that\u2019s outside your budget, we can just stick to our original terms.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nRelated\nFreelance Creatives: How to Tame Scope-Creeping Clients\n\n\n\n\n3. Always Refer Back to the Project Requirements\nNow, this requires actually outlining project requirements in the beginning with your client. I\u2019ve made the mistake of working without project requirements clearly documented. And it\u2019s a mistake every time.\nAt the beginning of each project, I take time to clarify goals and objectives. This is the initial planning stage. And it saves me from a huge headache down the road.\nIt\u2019s important that I balance my timeline, bandwidth and resources against the project\u2019s complexity. This helps me define the functionality of specific deliverables. Deliverables get broken down into tasks and milestones.\nUltimately, this sets clear expectations of what I deliver in a project.\nBut despite my efforts to outline everything, scope creep still happens. And sometimes, it\u2019s easiest to simply point clients to the documented project requirements. Here\u2019s a script for that scenario:\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that you\u2019re so excited about what I\u2019m doing that you want to add more. Unfortunately, what you\u2019re asking goes outside of our original project requirements. I\u2019ve attached them to this email for your convenience. Should we discuss expanding the budget and project requirements? I\u2019d be happy to meet with you later this week.\u201d\n4. Develop an Approval Process for Scope Change Requests\nLike I said before, I\u2019m not a huge fan of saying no. As a business professional, this made my life pretty difficult for a while. Some days I felt like the only word I used all day was no.\nIt left me feeling pretty discouraged.\nAnd then I realized that I shouldn\u2019t feel so much pressure about making this decision. In fact, I shouldn\u2019t feel any pressure at all. Like every other aspect of the project, it\u2019s my job to manage, not execute.\nThat\u2019s when I realized the power of a project scope change management process. I don\u2019t use it for every decision, because there are some things that require an easy yes or no. But I use this system when it comes to larger requests. And it works like a charm.\nNow, a client or client manager comes to me with a scope change request. Instead of feeling the pressure of making a yes or no decision on the spot, I use something like this:\n\u201cThanks for sharing this great idea. I can see why you\u2019d like to add it into the project. Something of this magnitude needs to get the approval of our project sponsor, though. I\u2019ll need to pitch the idea to him. Please shoot me an email back with the following information: the new capabilities/functionality, the business value of the change, and any consequences that could occur if we don\u2019t make the change.\u201d\n5. Protect Yourself from Gold Plating\nGold plating happens when you continue to work on a project or task, even though you\u2019ve already met the outlined requirements. I\u2019ve done this before, and it comes from a good place. But you shouldn\u2019t keep working past the scope you\u2019ve discussed with the client.\nThat\u2019s right, scope creep doesn\u2019t just come from clients. You and I can fall victim to it too.\nI once worked with a marketing team that never had a dedicated project manager. It was up to the team to work together and get things done on time. As you can imagine, it became a nightmare.\nBut out of all the issues, gold plating caused the biggest issue. Developers ran wild making big promises outside the scope of the initial project. At the end of the day, the business took a turn for the worse. Why? Because the project wasn\u2019t profitable due to the extra time spent gold plating.\nIf you run a team, you must teach them how to manage project scope. Here\u2019s a simple script to combat a team member that\u2019s easing into scope creep:\n\u201cWow. It looks like you\u2019ve been hard at work. I appreciate your diligence to this project, it\u2019s very encouraging. Now, this may seem silly, but please don\u2019t go above the call-of-duty too much. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t stretch outside the bound of our initial project requirements. (If you haven\u2019t seen them yet, I\u2019ve attached the document for you.) Again, thanks for all your hard work. You rock.\u201d\nThose are five scope creep scripts you can use today. As project managers, freelancers and business owners, it\u2019s important that we manage this important aspect of business.\n\n\n\n\nRelated\nHow to Use Contracts to Ensure You Get Paid\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever let scope creep happen? Which of these scripts could you start using today to make sure it never happens again?

I\u2019ve consulted businesses for a few years, so I think I can understand most people\u2019s perspectives, whether they\u2019re coming from a media perspective or an enterprise side. I\u2019ll try to give you an unbiased analysis here, though which framework you choose depends on your needs. If i came up here and just said \u201cthis one\u2019s better than this one\u201d, I think it would be disingenuous. So, here are a few pros and cons of each framework.\nAngularJS\n\nPROS:\nTesting\nIf you\u2019re in an enterprise shop, particularly one with Java or Ruby on Rails background, you will really like what Angular offers in terms of testing. While other web frameworks may support testing, Angular goes beyond that and has built-in dependency injection, which is a big plus on Angular\u2019s side if you really care about testing.\nVision\nAngularJS has always been pushing the envelop on browser support. In addition, it thought about mobile support before other frameworks, along with ECMAScript 6 and web components. Thus, AngularJS\u2019s team is very forward-thinking and have a lot of vision.\nCONS:\nThe Built-in Router\nMost people don\u2019t actually use the router in AngularJS. Of course, there is an open source alternative, AngularUI Router, and there was actually a Codementor Office Hours by Dean Sofer, who is part of the AngularUI team who briefly talks about it. AngularUI Router basically erases this weakness, but to be fair by comparing framework to framework straight up, Ember was the first there with a really strong router while Angular\u2019s native router is not so great.\nFor example, if you have a list of items and the details for those items, you would picture in a Ruby on Rails app to have a /list-route, and then a /details-itemID for the detail. However, in reality, people will want to see the list and details on the same page, they might want the list on a left-hand side of the menu. When they click an item they would expect to be able to drill into its details. While this kind of complex interaction is possible with the basic Angular router, you\u2019d actually be hiding and showing things, which is not very native. You don\u2019t have the ability to put the code in its own isolated place for a detailed view and put the list view in its own isolated place.\nIn contrast, if you have a robust router as in Ember or the AngularUI router, you\u2019d have a nested view, where a detail route would be underneath a list route and can be composed or pulled apart in a nested hierarchy, which is super powerful. In addition, both Ember and AngularUI router also allows you to have named views, which is useful if you\u2019re going to divide your page into a header, footer, sidebar, left navigation, and so on. Basically, named views will also allow you to have an isolated set of code, a controller (in Angular\u2019s case), and a scope to each of those pieces so you can compose them up. The native Angular router does not have such a feature. The Angular team is currently rewriting the router for their new framework, and details about it hasn\u2019t been released. However, with the AngularUI Router, this shouldn\u2019t be an issue in choosing which framework to use.\nDirectives\nDirectives are Angular\u2019s core feature, and also a big weakness because so many people find it difficult to write them. Angular is talking about fixing this in newer versions, but at the moment directives can make Angular rather tough for some developers.\nEmber.js\n\nPROS:\nthe Router\nAs mentioned before, Ember\u2019s built-in router is very strong. It is a full state-machine, as is the AngularUI Router for Angular.\nVision\nEmber has done pretty well with their vision, such as seeing object.observe() beforehand, following Angular\u2019s path and thinking about web components early, etc.\nThe Component Model\nUnlike Angular\u2019s directives, Ember\u2019s web components are much simpler because they\u2019re not trying to do much. Instead, their components are trying to be simple UI widgets or components, so the API is much cleaner and easier to understand.\nCONS:\nTesting\nEmber doesn\u2019t do the dirty checking that is common in Angular. They use getters and setters, and you need to remember them to access properties on your objects. This can be a pain because you can forget and actually just . to a property and then get a strange bug in the application. You\u2019d then have to spend some having to track that error down, so it\u2019s not as natural as having properties that are just raw, plain-old JavaScript objects as they are in Angular.\nBackbone.js\n\nPROS:\nLightweight\nIf you have a legacy or a brown-field app, want to clean up the messy jQuery code, and haven\u2019t decided what framework to adopt, it may be a good idea to bring Backbone in. It\u2019s super small, more of a library than a framework, and you can use it to refactor old code, clean things up, and get some more modularity around the things you\u2019re doing.\nPerformance Control\nCompared to other frameworks, Backbone gives you a lot more control over performance, particularly in mobile scenarios. Therefore, if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s really comfortable in JavaScript and don\u2019t want a framework in your way, or if you\u2019re concerned about running into performance bottlenecks that may result from a framework\u2019s 2-way data binding, you may be comfortable with Backbone.\nCONS:\nProductivity\nAs Backbone is more like a library, which means it doesn\u2019t try to put much of its opinion on you, this also means it doesn\u2019t help you as much and doesn\u2019t write as much of your code for you.\nThis is not to say you\u2019re not going to be productive with backbone, but you certainly would have more code to write. A large reason for that would be the lack of 2-way data binding, which is a key feature a lot of people really liked about Angular and Ember.\nArchitecture\nAs Backbone does not have much of an opinion, architecture is unclear at times, which can make it challenging to get up to speed on some things.\nMemory Leaking\nThis is a big con of Backbone, since if you\u2019re not a JavaScript guru and don\u2019t always know what you\u2019re doing with JavaScript, Backbone might not be a good choice to adopt as it may be easier for you to end up leaking memory when you\u2019re writing applications.\nConclusion\nAs far as Angular and Ember go, it would be a reasonable choice to pick either. Backbone may sound less preferred, though this actually has to do with the generations of what has happened in building rich JavaScript applications.\nAt first, there was plain old JavaScript, in which back in the day no one wanted to write it when it was just that due to all of the cross-browser issues. Then jQuery came along, and since it can be summarized to be a DOM manipulation library, it removed the cross-browser issues. It also had an AJAX API that enabled a lot of things, so it was sort of the second step in the evolution of building JavaScript applications.\nThe third generation would be Backbone and Knockout. Those two came about because people were realizing at that point that they weren\u2019t able to reuse code and pages when they wrote jQuery applications, and they felt as though they were writing these nested codes. Of course, they could write good jQuery code, but it wasn\u2019t leading them into success all the time. Promises make things better, but you can still quickly break the back button by making a few AJAX calls with your jQuery code. As you build more of your app in JavaScript, you eventually hit the edge of jQuery. Backbone helped make code cleaner, and there were a lot of micro-frameworks competing against it, but Backbone won. In addition, people really liked the 2-way data-binding in Knockout.\nFinally, the next evolution of frameworks came along, which is Angular and Ember. They gathered all the ideas of what people liked and put together a more inclusive framework as opposed to a library.\nTherefore, if you think about the generations of JavaScript\u2019s evolution, personally I\u2019d prefer to be using the newer generation of tools. However, as mentioned before, there are exceptions to that, and the most common being performance. There\u2019s a lot of magic happening for you in Angular and Ember, and with this magic, particularly in the data-binding front, you could run into some performance concerns\u2014particularly on the mobile side.\nThe Angular team sort of recognized this issue, and in the newest version (1.3) that just came out not long ago, one of the major features was improved performance.\nOn the other hand, if you look at what the Ember team is doing besides building tools, you\u2019d notice their HTMLbars project. It will sort of revolutionize their data-binding approach, as well as their approach to the DOM and their templating engine. As a result, Ember has gotten a lot faster as well.\nThus, in early versions of Angular and Ember, there were mobile performance problems if you had a lot of items on a page, while in Backbone you could have a fine grain control over things. Altogether, which framework you choose will depend on what you\u2019re doing with the framework, but hopefully this will give you a simple idea.\nWhat Others Are Choosing\nFor me it would be subjective to say which I see more of, but you can look at online statistics from github stuff as well as questions on stack overflow to get an idea. From my experience via picking up corporate training gigs, Angular clearly has a popularity advantage over Ember, but it took a big hit in the last few weeks in its announcement of a new 2.0, and Ember came out strong.\nIf you\u2019re in a Rails shop and have a lot of Rails developers, you might want to think hard about Ember because the conventions are so similar. This is because one of the core contributors to Ember was on the jQuery core team and Rails core times, and he is now the creator of Ember with Tom dale with other people. So, basically Ember is very friendly to Rails developers in terms of built tools and developer experience.\nAlso, if you really care about URLs and SEO and you still want to use one of these rich frameworks, Ember\u2019s built-in router would make it a bit more SEO-friendly. However, JavaScript Frameworks, SPA, and SEO generally aren\u2019t compatible, and you can read more about it here.\n\nOther posts in this series with Craig McKeachie:\n\nShould You Use a JavaScript MVC to Build Your Web Application?\nAngular vs Ember vs Backbone: What Should JavaScript Beginners Learn?\nShould You Wait Until Angular 2.0 is Released Before Learning AngularJS?\nMV* Frameworks Office Hours Q&A: REACT.js, Angular Design Practices, and More\n\n\nCodementor Craig McKeachie has been a software developer for nearly 20 years, mostly on the Microsoft stack.

And that\u2019s how it happens, sneaking up suddenly and hitting you and your project where it hurts.We all need to be careful about dealing with increasing or changing scope in order to avoid nasty surprises. In this article, I\u2019m going to discuss:What scope creep isHow it can hurt your projectsHow to mitigate it when it happensI\u2019ll be delving into real world examples of scope creep in agile projects\u2014where there isn\u2019t even a fixed scope to begin with. Also important, I\u2019ll talk about the positive aspects of a changing scope and arm you with a sound approach to embrace it. Because change can be good!https://www.buzzsprout.com/109730/838216-controlling-scope-creeps-with-suze-haworth.js?player=smallWhat Is Scope Creep?So what is scope creep, exactly? Simply put, it occurs when the scope, deliverables, or features on a project expand from what was originally set\u2014without being accounted for in additional time or budget. It can affect any fixed scope project. It\u2019s a very common thing, as it can happen both intentionally and unintentionally, stemming from any number of the people involved in a project.Unfortunately, scope creep can lead to project failure: maybe you don\u2019t hit the deadline, you burn through the entire budget (and more), and all without delivering the right thing. And who wants that?!How Does Scope Creep Undermine A Project?Has it happened to me? Yes, plenty of times! Here\u2019s a quick scope creep case study from my experience to illustrate how easily it happens\u2014and how it doesn\u2019t always come from a direct client request:Case Study: My Experience With Scope CreepI inherited a project with a more classic Waterfall setup: there were wireframes and a design phase, which then moved into the development stage. I picked it up as it was entering development. It was straightforward enough: we were building the frontend on top of a white-labelled backend from another agency. We had signed off wireframes and designs and had run through everything with the client and agency\u2026what could possibly go wrong?Well! It turns out that the other agency was iterating on their backend build and frequently releasing new code. Funnily enough, they didn\u2019t account for us building on top of the old code, so our code broke with every release\u2026 *deep sigh*.This meant we had to go back through our code, updating it to work with the continuous changes from the other agency. This was unaccounted for\u2014but it was work we had to do. At first, we did the odd, small fix on an ad hoc basis, but more and more problems started to occur. Although we raised this with client, we tried to fold the extra work into our project rather than flagging to the client that we needed to determine a solution together before proceeding with the build.Oh, the benefit of hindsight! What happened? We fell deeper and deeper into redeveloping the existing code\u2014timelines got extended, we missed our deadline, and we came under a lot of pressure towards the end of the project. The team was demotivated, the client wasn\u2019t happy, and none of this was actually our fault! In the end, the project was delayed by two months, a huge amount of time, unaccounted for. In the end, all we wanted was to wash our hands of it and forget it ever happened.So, what could we have done?The People Involved: Who Actually Causes Scope CreepIt\u2019s useful to take a look at your project and identify who could be causing scope creep. This can help you to identify it early and determine your approach to solving the issue. Hint: it\u2019s not always the client causing these issues, as you can see in my example above.Team MemberScope creep can come from people in your internal team for a number of reasons:1. The team member is unclear on what the scope of the project is.Ensure that at the beginning of the project, any requirements or deliverables are already outlined and everyone working in the team is fully aware of these. If scope is being set, make sure conversations involve the team that will be working on the project as much as you can. If that\u2019s not possible, at the very least run a kick-off meeting with the team and make sure everyone is fully aware of what has been agreed upon. Then, during the project, make sure you hold regular team check-ins to keep everyone on the same page.2. The team member wants to develop what they want to develop, and not what\u2019s in scope.People have much more understanding when they are involved\u2014when they feel like they own it. Involving your team in setting the scope is really useful in getting their buy-in for what they\u2019ll design and build. Make sure everyone is working as a team. If someone goes away to produce something out of scope because they want to, others on the project won\u2019t be as invested in what is happening, causing friction and differing ideas on what the scope is.3. The team member makes decisions in a vacuum.Sometimes, team member chooses a way to solve a problem that has an impact on scope, often without realizing. Even adding a half day of extra work to do something slightly different could impact the rest of your project. For example, if a designer or UX person decides to include some functionality on a site without discussing with the developer, who knows what this could do to your overall scope, without any investigation?Make sure you set your team up from the beginning of a project to work together and understand each others\u2019 decisions. When someone raises a query or issue with you directly, share it with everyone if there\u2019s a bigger decision to be made. Get people working together to define and find solutions to problems. Make sure everyone is in contact (whether face-to-face or remote) regularly. Most successful projects are enabled by teams that work well together.Internal StakeholdersYour project scope can be influenced internally in your organisation from senior stakeholders. They might have a vision for the organisation that involves delivering more for your project, or they might want to push a different agenda. For example, sometimes a client relationship is more important to an organisation than staying within scope in your particular project.Make sure your internal stakeholders understand what you are trying to deliver and by when. If something would have a knock-on effect on your project, clearly lay out what impact this will have\u2014whether it\u2019s financial, perception-based, or otherwise.UsersUser testing should (hopefully) be part of your project or product set up. User feedback on a product can influence a course of events that ultimately increases scope. What happens if you get feedback from your users showing that something that you can\u2019t ignore? Even if it might increase your scope, it needs to be addressed.When you\u2019ve collated results from testing, review with your team to identify the necessary changes to implement. Prioritize so you understand which changes would have the greatest impact to the users\u2019 experience. Then, work out what level of changes you can comfortably incorporate without affecting scope. If any of the necessary changes would mean increased scope, speak to your client or stakeholder about it. Also important is to make sure you have an understanding of what impact not implementing the change would have.3rd partiesAs we saw in my personal case study, dependencies coming from other parties can affect your feed. Whether that\u2019s an external company, third-party APIs, content providers\u2014if you are relying on anyone else externally to complete the project, you need to be aware of the impact they can have.Make sure you identify your project dependencies when you kick-off the project. Try to think about what impact they could have on your project, and how they could affect your scope. For example, what if your content provider sent you content that wasn\u2019t in the format that was easiest to implement or upload within the website. Could this add extra time your side? Obviously, you\u2019ll never cover every eventuality\u2014but having this risk-planning frame of mind at the beginning means that you can raise these dependencies at the beginning of your project with the client or stakeholder and ensure they understand the potential impact.YouThe biggest issue when it comes to you, the project manager, causing scope creep stems from the temptation to try and make things work within your existing budget and timeline, without flagging to your client or stakeholder. Yes, it can be a difficult conversation when you have to say you can\u2019t do something unless you raise a change request\u2014but this conversation is a lot easier to have earlier on, rather than down the line when you\u2019re over time and budget.Make sure you\u2019re raising issues as soon as they happen, rather than waiting. If you or your team identify an issue, work through possible scenarios for different solutions, and present them to the client or stakeholder. For example, if extra work is necessary, see what can be descoped instead\u2014is there anything you are doing in your project that isn\u2019t needed for the first release?ClientAnd yes, we can\u2019t conclude this section without mentioning the obvious: the client. This one is in fact easier to spot, as most PMs are already primed to do so! Be aware of clients adding in small requests that gradually build up, changing their mind on what was agreed, or suggesting new ways to do things that can affect the amount of effort needed. Make sure you\u2019re honest and upfront with them if they are asking for something that will cause scope creep. Also, frame your responses so that you aren\u2019t just saying \u201cno\u201d all the time. Try to phrase it so that you are suggesting an alternative, for example:\u201cThis new request is going to have this specific impact on time/budget. We\u2019ve taken a look at the priorities\u2014how about replacing this with that instead? It achieves a similar outcome because\u2026\u201d10 Common Causes Of Scope Creep (And How To Eliminate Them)1. 1. Not having a clear scopeClarity is extremely important on any project. If you don\u2019t clearly define your scope at the beginning, it can cause big problems down the line.How to eliminate it: make sure the scope is clear to everyone working on the project. Involve your team in setting the scope so that they are bought into what they are delivering.2. Not having client agreementIf the client isn\u2019t bought into the scope, they are likely to change their mind\u2014and the deliverables\u2014later on.How to eliminate it: ensure the client understands what is\u2014and isn\u2019t\u2014in scope. Don\u2019t just send a document outlining the deliverables\u2014speak to them and walk them through it properly. Be transparent: ask questions such as, \u201cAre you clear on what this deliverable is and what you\u2019ll get?\u201d3. Not involving the client throughoutGone are the days where you do a month or two of work and then send the final results of this period to your client for feedback. This results in surprises, with finalized work having to be redone, and impacts the project timeline and budget.How to eliminate it: collaborate closely with your client. Show them the work in progress, iterate, and proactively involve them throughout the journey.4. Not raising issues proactivelyHiding behind issues and not being transparent with the client or stakeholder seems easier at first, but you\u2019ll come to regret it later on.How to eliminate it: raise issues right away, when they happen (just make sure you\u2019ve had time to work through some solutions first!).5. QA needing more time than estimatedAh, the age-old issue of QA estimation. How can you accurately estimate how many bugs will be raised, how long they will take to fix, and what impact this will have?How to eliminate it: estimate a percentage of the development work based on the complexity of build, then add contingency. Don\u2019t just throw a percentage at this\u2014speak to the QA Analyst and get them to review. Additionally, pre-define the browsers and devices you\u2019ll test against, along with the types of issues. This will help you refine your QA estimate. Also, consider using automated testing to save time\u2014the articles Pros and Cons of Manual and Automated Testing and Best Automation Tools provide background on automated testing.6. Not prioritizing among featuresIn a Waterfall-style project, your product will likely be built step-by-step until you reach the whole, shiny, new thing. This could lead to thinking everything is a priority. If you don\u2019t have clear priorities among features, it\u2019s hard to understand what can be descoped when adjustments to requirements begin to surface.Side note: this is not a Waterfall vs Agile debate\u2014that can be saved for a rainy day! Or see my article here on it.How to eliminate it: prioritize features by identifying what\u2019s necessary for releasing a usable product. Consider a more Agile approach where you build the minimum for release as quickly as possible: identify which features are absolutely necessary for users, and build a working product that can be tested and used by a customer at each stage.I love this diagram by Henrik Kniberg and the accompanying article to highlight the approach above.7. Not agreeing on how to handle changeIf you haven\u2019t agreed on how to handle change at the beginning of a project, it only makes sense that it\u2019s going to be difficult to work through changes in scope at a later date.How to eliminate it: outline in your Statement of Work (or similar document) how you\u2019ll handle change. If you\u2019ll use Change Requests, ensure you detail what\u2019s in scope, what\u2019s out of scope, and how to raise a Change Request.8. Estimating poorlyEstimation is very difficult to get right. It\u2019s a challenge to be accurate at the beginning of a project when there are many unknowns. Certain things may not get accounted for, and you end up tied to this extra scope to be able to deliver your overall project.How to eliminate it: involve your whole team in estimation. Don\u2019t work in a silo and make guesses. Ensure you\u2019ve explored and determined client and business requirements against user requirements before estimating. Instead of estimating based on deliverables, look at the following:Estimate for a discovery period to determine what you\u2019ll be building\u2014at the end of this you can provide a more accurate estimate for the rest of the project.Consider using a Time and Materials pricing model rather than Fixed Price. Since you are billing actual hours on the project, it can be much more flexible. This handy article here which discusses benefits and uses of each.Don\u2019t specify exactly what features are being built and how within the scope\u2014allow room for change.9. Not interrogating new requestsIt\u2019s easy to take on new requests or ideas from clients or team members, believing that they are the right path forward (Well, they do know what they\u2019re doing, right?). If you don\u2019t interrogate these requests properly you could end up accepting new scope, duplicating work or building unnecessary features without noticing.How to eliminate it: review all new requests with the full team. Create a clear understanding of what the request is, the impact of incorporating it, and its outcome for the user. Then, prioritize the new request and cross check to make sure it\u2019s not already being delivered elsewhere.10. Not involving users early enoughI\u2019ve seen many a project go to the final stages (and even past that) before actually putting it in front of real users. It\u2019s tempting to fool ourselves thinking that we (the clients, the business, the team) know the users well enough to avoid interacting with them. If you\u2019re not incorporating user feedback early on, you can go far down a route that doesn\u2019t test well with users. At that point, your scope can suddenly spiral.How to eliminate it: get users using the product or service as early as possible. If the client or budget holder doesn\u2019t want to pay for this, work through the benefits and also the negative impact it could have by not performing this early user validation. Have a plan to address user feedback wherever it comes within the project.How To Manage Scope Creep In AgileScope creep generally applies to projects with a fixed scope. What if I\u2019m using an Agile methodology? Well, Agile embraces change\u2014and frankly, so should you, if you\u2019re working within different processes or methodologies. Change should not be seen as the enemy.As one of the core principles of Agile states:\u201cWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer\u2019s competitive advantage.\u201dIf you\u2019re working to Scrum methodology for example, when a new requirement comes in, pull it into the Sprint planning meeting and get it in the backlog. Prioritize it with the Product Owner and team, and if it does go into the Sprint, something else will be deprioritized instead. Because details aren\u2019t determined at the beginning of the project, change can be incorporated. Stories can be swapped quite easily for other stories if they require the same effort.The very point of Agile is to iterate, which means designing, building, testing, learning and then repeating the cycle. Change is what leads to the best possible product in the time you have. So what actually counts as scope creep in an Agile project? Since you should have the ability to change scope quite easily without throwing the whole project to the lions, scope creep in Agile doesn\u2019t really affect you until later down the line.Scope creep could come into play if your Product Owner doesn\u2019t deprioritize features or tasks when pulling something in\u2014i.e. if they want to add something into the current cycle without removing something else. Also, they might not weigh the effort needed between the new task and the deprioritized one, which could results in trying to cram extra effort into an already planned, too-tight cycle.Make sure that, for any new features entering the backlog, you\u2019re breaking these down into stories effectively and understanding effort against them to prioritize accordingly. If you have a Product Owner who understands this process, scope creep will be much less of a threat. In general, it\u2019s a lot easier to mitigate scope creep in an Agile project, precisely because change is encouraged and factored into the structure of the methodology itself.Five Core Ways To Manage Scope CreepBe proactive. Determine and agree upon a change management process upfront.Prioritize. Look at what can be descoped to accommodate new requests.Be transparent. As soon as scope creep appears, bring it up with clients and stakeholders.Analyze impacts. Work out the impacts (both positive and negative) of changes, and present solutions to your client or stakeholder in order to move forward.Embrace it. Work out what\u2019s necessary for a testable, usable product\u2014if that means changing scope, look at ways to incorporate the changes.See Scope Creep As A Positive!In my opinion, it\u2019s time to change the way we look at scope creep. Rather than seeing it as the sneaky enemy, we need to think of it differently. It\u2019s not scope creep\u2014it\u2019s change. How you manage that change is what affects the project\u2014not the request to change it. You just need to be careful that you spot it when it happens, especially when it\u2019s not obvious, and raise it before it progresses without any form of replanning.Change can actually be hugely beneficial to the product you\u2019re making. After all, we are all here to build the best products and services we can, and if that means requirements must change, then we, as project managers, need to lead the way for adapting to this.What Do You Think?Have you got any examples of scope creep? How did you tackle it? Or have you seen it positively affect a project where you\u2019ve incorporated a change in requirements and ended up with a much better outcome?

Keep in mind that Python is used for a great\nmany different purposes, and precisely how you want to manage your dependencies\nmay change based on how you decide to publish your software. The guidance\npresented here is most directly applicable to the development and deployment of\nnetwork services (including web applications), but is also very well suited to\nmanaging development and testing environments for any kind of project.\n\nNote\nThis guide is written for Python 3, however, these instructions\nshould work fine on Python 2.7\u2014if you are still using it, for some reason.\n\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve got Python & pip\u00b6\nBefore you go any further, make sure you have Python and that it\u2019s available\nfrom your command line. You can check this by simply running:\n$ python --version\n\n\nYou should get some output like 3.6.2. If you do not have Python, please\ninstall the latest 3.x version from python.org or refer to the\nInstalling Python section of this guide.\n\nNote\nIf you\u2019re newcomer and you get an error like this:\n>>> python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'python' is not defined\n\n\nIt\u2019s because this command is intended to be run in a shell (also called\na terminal or console). See the Python for Beginners\ngetting started tutorial for an introduction to using your operating\nsystem\u2019s shell and interacting with Python.\n\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have pip available. You can\ncheck this by running:\n$ pip --version\n\n\nIf you installed Python from source, with an installer from python.org, or\nvia Homebrew you should already have pip. If you\u2019re on Linux and installed\nusing your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately.\n\n\nInstalling Pipenv\u00b6\nPipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you\u2019re familiar\nwith Node.js\u2019 npm or Ruby\u2019s bundler, it is similar in spirit to those\ntools. While pip can install Python packages, Pipenv is recommended as\nit\u2019s a higher-level tool that simplifies dependency management for common use\ncases.\nUse pip to install Pipenv:\n$ pip install --user pipenv\n\n\n\nNote\nThis does a user installation to prevent breaking any system-wide\npackages. If pipenv isn\u2019t available in your shell after installation,\nyou\u2019ll need to add the user base\u2019s binary directory to your PATH.\nOn Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running\npython -m site --user-base and adding bin to the end. For example,\nthis will typically print ~/.local (with ~ expanded to the\nabsolute path to your home directory) so you\u2019ll need to add\n~/.local/bin to your PATH. You can set your PATH permanently by\nmodifying ~/.profile.\nOn Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running\npy -m site --user-site and replacing site-packages with\nScripts. For example, this could return\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python36\\site-packages so you would\nneed to set your PATH to include\nC:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python36\\Scripts. You can set your\nuser PATH permanently in the Control Panel. You may need to log\nout for the PATH changes to take effect.\n\n\n\nInstalling packages for your project\u00b6\nPipenv manages dependencies on a per-project basis. To install packages,\nchange into your project\u2019s directory (or just an empty directory for this\ntutorial) and run:\n$ cd project_folder\n$ pipenv install requests\n\n\nPipenv will install the excellent Requests library and create a Pipfile\nfor you in your project\u2019s directory. The Pipfile is used to track which\ndependencies your project needs in case you need to re-install them, such as\nwhen you share your project with others. You should get output similar to this\n(although the exact paths shown will vary):\nCreating a Pipfile for this project...\nCreating a virtualenv for this project...\nUsing base prefix '/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6'\nNew python executable in ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-agwWamBd/bin/python3.6\nAlso creating executable in ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-agwWamBd/bin/python\nInstalling setuptools, pip, wheel...done.\n\nVirtualenv location: ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/tmp-agwWamBd\nInstalling requests...\nCollecting requests\n  Using cached requests-2.18.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting idna<2.7,>=2.5 (from requests)\n  Using cached idna-2.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting urllib3<1.23,>=1.21.1 (from requests)\n  Using cached urllib3-1.22-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting chardet<3.1.0,>=3.0.2 (from requests)\n  Using cached chardet-3.0.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nCollecting certifi>=2017.4.17 (from requests)\n  Using cached certifi-2017.7.27.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nInstalling collected packages: idna, urllib3, chardet, certifi, requests\nSuccessfully installed certifi-2017.7.27.1 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.6 requests-2.18.4 urllib3-1.22\n\nAdding requests to Pipfile's [packages]...\nP.S. You have excellent taste! \u2728 \ud83c\udf70 \u2728\n\n\n\n\nUsing installed packages\u00b6\nNow that Requests is installed you can create a simple main.py file to\nuse it:\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip')\n\nprint('Your IP is {0}'.format(response.json()['origin']))\n\n\nThen you can run this script using pipenv run:\n$ pipenv run python main.py\n\n\nYou should get output similar to this:\nYour IP is 8.8.8.8\n\n\nUsing $ pipenv run ensures that your installed packages are available to\nyour script. It\u2019s also possible to spawn a new shell that ensures all commands\nhave access to your installed packages with $ pipenv shell.\n\n\nNext steps\u00b6\nCongratulations, you now know how to install and use Python packages! \u2728 \ud83c\udf70 \u2728\n\n\n\nLower level: virtualenv\u00b6\nvirtualenv is a tool to create\nisolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the\nnecessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.\nIt can be used standalone, in place of Pipenv.\nInstall virtualenv via pip:\n$ pip install virtualenv\n\n\nTest your installation:\n$ virtualenv --version\n\n\n\nBasic Usage\u00b6\n\nCreate a virtual environment for a project:\n\n$ cd project_folder\n$ virtualenv venv\n\n\nvirtualenv venv will create a folder in the current directory which will\ncontain the Python executable files, and a copy of the pip library which you\ncan use to install other packages. The name of the virtual environment (in this\ncase, it was venv) can be anything; omitting the name will place the files\nin the current directory instead.\n\nNote\n\u2018venv\u2019 is the general convention used globally. As it is readily available in ignore files (eg: .gitignore\u2019)\n\nThis creates a copy of Python in whichever directory you ran the command in,\nplacing it in a folder named venv.\nYou can also use the Python interpreter of your choice (like\npython2.7).\n$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv\n\n\nor change the interpreter globally with an env variable in ~/.bashrc:\n$ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7\n\n\n\nTo begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:\n\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n\n\nThe name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of\nthe prompt (e.g. (venv)Your-Computer:project_folder UserName$) to let you know\nthat it\u2019s active. From now on, any package that you install using pip will be\nplaced in the venv folder, isolated from the global Python installation.\nFor Windows, the same command mentioned in step 1 can be used to create a virtual environment. However, activating the environment requires a slightly different command.\nAssuming that you are in your project directory:\nC:\\Users\\SomeUser\\project_folder> venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n\nInstall packages using the pip command:\n$ pip install requests\n\n\n\nIf you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can\ndeactivate it:\n\n$ deactivate\n\n\nThis puts you back to the system\u2019s default Python interpreter with all its\ninstalled libraries.\nTo delete a virtual environment, just delete its folder. (In this case,\nit would be rm -rf venv.)\nAfter a while, though, you might end up with a lot of virtual environments\nlittered across your system, and it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll forget their names or\nwhere they were placed.\n\nNote\nPython has included venv module from version 3.3. For more details: venv.\n\n\n\nOther Notes\u00b6\nRunning virtualenv with the option --no-site-packages will not\ninclude the packages that are installed globally. This can be useful\nfor keeping the package list clean in case it needs to be accessed later.\n[This is the default behavior for virtualenv 1.7 and later.]\nIn order to keep your environment consistent, it\u2019s a good idea to \u201cfreeze\u201d\nthe current state of the environment packages. To do this, run:\n$ pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n\nThis will create a requirements.txt file, which contains a simple\nlist of all the packages in the current environment, and their respective\nversions. You can see the list of installed packages without the requirements\nformat using pip list. Later it will be easier for a different developer\n(or you, if you need to re-create the environment) to install the same packages\nusing the same versions:\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\nThis can help ensure consistency across installations, across deployments,\nand across developers.\nLastly, remember to exclude the virtual environment folder from source\ncontrol by adding it to the ignore list (see Version Control Ignores).\n\n\nvirtualenvwrapper\u00b6\nvirtualenvwrapper\nprovides a set of commands which makes working with virtual environments much\nmore pleasant. It also places all your virtual environments in one place.\nTo install (make sure virtualenv is already installed):\n$ pip install virtualenvwrapper\n$ export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs\n$ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n\n\n(Full virtualenvwrapper install instructions.)\nFor Windows, you can use the virtualenvwrapper-win.\nTo install (make sure virtualenv is already installed):\n$ pip install virtualenvwrapper-win\n\n\nIn Windows, the default path for WORKON_HOME is %USERPROFILE%\\Envs\n\nBasic Usage\u00b6\n\nCreate a virtual environment:\n\n$ mkvirtualenv project_folder\n\n\nThis creates the project_folder folder inside ~/Envs.\n\nWork on a virtual environment:\n\n$ workon project_folder\n\n\nAlternatively, you can make a project, which creates the virtual environment,\nand also a project directory inside $WORKON_HOME, which is cd-ed into\nwhen you workon project_folder.\n$ mkproject project_folder\n\n\nvirtualenvwrapper provides tab-completion on environment names. It really\nhelps when you have a lot of environments and have trouble remembering their\nnames.\nworkon also deactivates whatever environment you are currently in, so you\ncan quickly switch between environments.\n\nDeactivating is still the same:\n\n$ deactivate\n\n\n\nTo delete:\n\n$ rmvirtualenv venv\n\n\n\n\nOther useful commands\u00b6\n\nlsvirtualenv\nList all of the environments.\ncdvirtualenv\nNavigate into the directory of the currently activated virtual environment,\nso you can browse its site-packages, for example.\ncdsitepackages\nLike the above, but directly into site-packages directory.\nlssitepackages\nShows contents of site-packages directory.\n\nFull list of virtualenvwrapper commands.\n\n\n\nvirtualenv-burrito\u00b6\nWith virtualenv-burrito, you\ncan have a working virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper environment in a single command.\n\n\ndirenv\u00b6\nWhen you cd into a directory containing a .env, direnv\nautomagically activates the environment.\nInstall it on Mac OS X using brew:\n$ brew install direnv\n\n\nOn Linux follow the instructions at direnv.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nO'Reilly Book\nThis guide is now available in tangible book form!\n\nAll proceeds are being directly donated to the DjangoGirls organization.\nTranslations\n\nEnglish\nFrench\nChinese\nJapanese\nKorean\nFilipino\nBrazilian Portuguese\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nPipenv & Virtual Environments\nMake sure you\u2019ve got Python & pip\nInstalling Pipenv\nInstalling packages for your project\nUsing installed packages\nNext steps\n\n\nLower level: virtualenv\nBasic Usage\nOther Notes\nvirtualenvwrapper\nBasic Usage\nOther useful commands\n\n\nvirtualenv-burrito\ndirenv\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\nDocumentation overview\nPrevious: Installing Python 2 on Linux\nNext: Your Development Environment\n\n\n\n\nQuick search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92011-2020 Kenneth Reitz & Real Python.

Instead of storing data on the client, only a\nsecurely generated ID is stored on the client, while the actual session data\nresides on the server.\nThis has two major advantages:\n\nClients no longer see the session information\nIt is possible to securely destroy sessions to protect against replay\nattacks.\n\nOther things are possible with server side session that are impossible with\nclients side sessions, like inspecting and manipulating data in absence of the\nclient.\nFlask-KVSession uses the simplekv-package\nfor storing session data on a variety of backends, including redis, memcached, SQL databases using\nSQLAlchemy, mongoDB or\njust flat files.\nIntegration with Flask is seamless, once the extension is loaded for a Flask\napplication, it transparently replaces Flask\u2019s own Session management. Any\napplication working with sessions should work the same with Flask-KVSession\n(if it does not, file a bug!).\n\nDocumentation and development\u00b6\nDevelopment happens on github,\nyou can find the documentation on PyPI.\n\n\nExample use\u00b6\nimport redis\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask_kvsession import KVSessionExtension\nfrom simplekv.memory.redisstore import RedisStore\n\nstore = RedisStore(redis.StrictRedis())\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nKVSessionExtension(store, app)\n\n\nThe snippet above will activate KVSession, from now on all session data will be\nstored in the KeyValueStore supplied to the\nKVSessionExtension constructor.\n\n\nExpiring sessions\u00b6\nSessions will expire, causing them to be invalid. To be automatically removed\nfrom the backend as well, that backend must support the\nTimeToLiveMixin interface; example backends that support\nthis are are RedisStore and\nMemcacheStore.\nWhen using a different backend without time-to-live support, for example flat\nfiles through FilesystemStore,\ncleanup_sessions() can be called\nperiodically to remove unused sessions.\n\n\nNamespacing sessions\u00b6\nOccasionally, it is handy to namespace session keys (for example, when sharing\na Redis-database). This can be achieved using\nPrefixDecorator:\nstore = ...  # setup store normally\nprefixed_store = PrefixDecorator('sessions_', store)\n\n# ...\n\nKVSessionExtension(prefixed_store, app)\n\n\nThe decorator will transparently prefix sessions_ to every session key\nstored and strip it upon retrieval.\n\nNote\nThis requires simplekv>=0.9.2.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\u00b6\nIn addition to SESSION_COOKIE_NAME and PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME (see Flask\ndocumentation), the following configuration settings are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSESSION_KEY_BITS\nThe size of the random integer to be used when\ngenerating random session ids. Defaults to 64.\n\nSESSION_RANDOM_SOURCE\nRandom source to use, defaults to an instance of\nrandom.SystemRandom.\n\nSESSION_SET_TTL\nWhether or not to set the time-to-live of the\nsession on the backend, if supported. Default\nis True.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI reference\u00b6\nflask_kvsession is a drop-in replacement module for Flask sessions that uses a\nsimplekv.KeyValueStore as a backend for server-side sessions.\n\n\nclass flask_kvsession.KVSessionExtension(session_kvstore=None, app=None)\u00b6\nActivates Flask-KVSession for an application.\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\nsession_kvstore \u2013 An object supporting the\nsimplekv.KeyValueStore interface that session\ndata will be store in.\napp \u2013 The app to activate. If not None, this is essentially the\nsame as calling init_app() later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncleanup_sessions(app=None)\u00b6\nRemoves all expired session from the store.\nPeriodically, this function can be called to remove sessions from\nthe backend store that have expired, as they are not removed\nautomatically unless the backend supports time-to-live and has been\nconfigured appropriately (see TimeToLiveMixin).\nThis function retrieves all session keys, checks they are older than\nPERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME and if so, removes them.\nNote that no distinction is made between non-permanent and permanent\nsessions.\n\n\n\n\nParameters:app \u2013 The app whose sessions should be cleaned up. If None,\nuses flask.current_app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninit_app(app, session_kvstore=None)\u00b6\nInitialize application and KVSession.\nThis will replace the session management of the application with\nFlask-KVSession\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\nParameters:app \u2013 The Flask app to be initialized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass flask_kvsession.SessionID(id, created=None)\u00b6\nHelper class for parsing session ids.\nInternally, Flask-KVSession stores session ids that are serialized as\nKEY_CREATED, where KEY is a random number (the sessions \u201ctrue\u201d id)\nand CREATED a UNIX-timestamp of when the session was created.\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\nid \u2013 An integer to be used as the session key.\ncreated \u2013 A datetime instance or None.

JavaScript frameworks, like AngularJS, Ember.js, or ReactJS, bring structure to your code and keep it organized, thus making your app more flexible and scalable, and the development process \u2013 easier.\nVolatility of Javascript Scene\n\nThe web development has been changing very quickly. Almost every month a new JavaScript framework is being introduced, and existing frameworks are being updated very often.As these frameworks are of an open source kind, large communities around the world can constantly enrich them. And as the result, understanding the benefits of each framework and the difference between them is not an easy task.\nAngular vs. React vs. Ember: Deep Dive\n\nMany developers are confused by a large number of JavaScript frameworks available as frameworks look and function very differently.\nLet\u2019s weigh the advantages of three the most popular and widely-used JavaScript frameworks for the web: AngularJS, ReactJS and Ember.js.\nMeet the Frameworks\n\n\n\nFramework\nAngularJS\nReactJS\nEmber.js\n\n\nWhat is it?\nSuperheroic JavaScript MVW Framework\nA JavaScript library for building user interfaces and not only\nA framework for creating ambitious web applications\n\n\nFounded\nFounded in 2009 by Mi\u0161ko Hevery\nCreated by Jordan Walke, open sourced in 2013\nInitially created as SproutCore in 2007 by Yehuda Katz, acquired by Facebook and renamed to EmberJS in 2011\n\n\nHomepage\nhttps://angularjs.org/\nhttps://reactjs.net/\nhttp://emberjs.com/\n\n\nGithub\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/ember.js\n\n\nBug report\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues\n\n\n\nLicenses\nMIT\nMIT\nBSD-3-Clause\n\n\nPopular websites that use technology\nYoutube, Vevo, Freelancer, Istockphoto, Weather, Sky Store\nFacebook, Instagram, Khan Academy, New York Times, Airbnb, Flipkart, Sony Lifelog\nApple Music, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, TinderBox, Netflix, Groupon\n\n\nIdeal for\nBuilding highly active and interactive web applications.\nLarge web applications whose data is set to change frequently\nDynamic SPAs\n\n\n\nAngularJS: Champion of the Framework Space\n\nAngularJS is an open-source web application framework with Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture (Angular 1) and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture (Angular 2), powered by Google. It is the oldest of the three frameworks named above. As the result, it has the largest community. Angular.js solves the problem of developing SPA\u2019s (single page applications) by extending the functionality of HTML with directives. The framework places an emphasis on getting your app up and running quickly.\nPros and Cons of AngularJS\nBenefits:\n\nCreation of customized Document Object Model (DOM) elements.\nStraightforward UI design and alteration.\nWhen creating input fields in an HTML document, a separate data binding is created for each rendered field. Angular tends to check every single bound field on the page for any changes before re-rendering.\nDependency injection.\nSimple routing.\nEasy-to-test code.\nThe framework facilitates extension of HTML syntax and creates reusable components by directives.\nRobust template-building solutions. Uses binding expressions in HTML attributes to drive the templating functionality. Angular\u2019s templating engine has a deep understanding of the DOM, and its well-structured templates reduce the overall amount of code required to create the resulting page.\nData modelling is limited to the use of small data models in order to make the code simple and easy to test.\nFast when rendering static lists.\nGreat with code reuse (Angular libraries).\n\nPain points:\n\nComplexity of the directives API.\nFor pages with many interactive elements, Angular becomes slow.\nOriginal design tends to be slow.\nConcerns with performance because of many DOM elements.\nComplex third-party integration.\nSteep learning curve.\nScopes are easy to use, but hard to debug.\nRouter is limited.\n\nNote. The functionalities of Angular 2 differ from the above described. Angular 2 was not redesigned from Angular 1, it was completely rewritten. The drastic changes between two versions of the framework created considerable controversy among developers.\nReactJS: The New Kid on the Block\n\nReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library for building performant user interfaces with a focus on amazing rendering performance, introduced and powered by Facebook. React is focused on \u201cV\u201d in Model View Controller architecture. After React was first announced, it quickly achieved critical mass. It was built in order to solve the common problem with other JavaScript frameworks \u2013 efficient rendering of large data sets.\nPros and Cons of ReactJS\nBenefits:\n\nEasy interface design and learning API.\nSignificant performance gains over other JavaScript frameworks.\nFaster updates. React creates a new virtual DOM and a patching mechanism with the most recent data and efficiently compares it against the previous version, creating a minimal list of update portions to be made to the real DOM to bring it in sync, rather than having to re-render the entire site on each change.\nServer-side rendering allows to create isomorphic/universal web apps.\nEasy import of components although having very little dependencies.\nGood code reuse.\nGreat for JavaScript debugging.\nIt is entirely possible to augment Angular with React to enhance performance of troublesome components.\nFully component based architecture.\nJSX, a JavaScript extension syntax allowing quoting of HTML and using HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.\nReact Native Library.\n\nPain Points:\n\nIt\u2019s not a full framework, it\u2019s a library.\nVery sophisticated view layer.\nFlux architectures are a different paradigm that what developers are used to.\nLots of people dislike JSX.\nSteep learning curve.\nIntegrating React into a traditional MVC framework such as Rails would require some configurations.\n\nEmber.js: All the Heavy Lifting\n\nEmber.js is an open-source JavaScript application framework for creating single-page client-side web applications, which uses Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The framework provides universal data binding together and URL-driven approach for structuring different applications with the focus on scalability.\nEmber was originated as SproutCore in 2007. In 2011 it was acquired by Facebook and renamed to Ember. It combines proven concepts from native frameworks like Apple\u2019s Cocoa with the lightweight sensibilities.\nPros and Cons of Ember.js\nBenefits:\n\nConvention over configuration. Instead of providing detailed configuration for the various routes in your application, Ember.js favors following naming conventions and automatically generating the resulting code, earmarking configurations only for cases where convention is not followed.\nClient-side rendering and structure to scalable web applications beyond the view layer.\nURL-support.\nEmber\u2019s object model facilitates Key-Value Observation.\nNested UIs.\nMinimizes DOM.\nWorks well with large application ecosystems.\nStrong data layer integrates well with Java.\nFully-fledged templating mechanism (Handlebars templating engine built upon the popular Mustache templating engine) reduces the overall amount of code written. It knows nothing about DOM and relies instead upon straight text manipulation, building the HTML document dynamically.\nUses observers to change values, which results in only rendering the values being changed.\nAvoids \u201cdirty checking\u201d by using accessories.\nFaster boot times and inherent stability.\nPerformance focus.\nFriendly docs and API.\n\nPain Points:\n\nEmber.js lacks the reuse of components at Controller level.\nThere is a lot of outdated content and examples that no longer work.\nSteep learning curve.\nHandlebars pollutes the DOM with many <script> tags, which it uses as markers to keep the templates up to date with your model.\nCumbersome when going outside its typical uses.\nEmber\u2019s object model implementation bloats Ember\u2019s overall size and call stack while debugging.\nThe most opinionated and heaviest of the frameworks.\nOverblown for small projects.\nTesting story seems vague/incomplete.\n\nComparing AngularJS vs. ReactJS vs. Ember.js Features\n\n\n\nFeature\nAngularJS\nReactJS\nEmber.js\n\n\nDynamic UI Binding\nAllows using UI binding at plain object or even property level. More than one binding can be updated simultaneously without time-consuming DOM updates.\nStraightforward linking of states directly to the UI. The state parameter is passed as an object and merged into the internal state of reference of your React Component.\nUses Handlebars default template engine. You have to use a specific setter method on your Model to update a value, which is bound to the UI, while Handlebars renders your page. Other binding options include a possibility to have your Model in either one or two-way binding mode between a View and even another Model.\n\n\nReusable Components\nAngular components are called \u201cdirectives\u201d, and they are significantly more powerful than Ember components. They enable to create your own semantic and reusable HTML syntax.\nUses mixins at view and controller level, so that components don\u2019t have to be UI-related and may contain just some utilities or even complex program logic.\nWidget-based approach called Ember components. Handlebars layout and Ember\u2019s backend infrastructure enable to write your own application-specific HTML tags. Custom elements then can be used in any Handlebar template.\n\n\nRouting\nRequires a template or controller to its router configuration, which have to be managed manually.\nReact doesn\u2019t handle routing. But has a lot of modules for routing e.g. react-router, flow-router.\nMore powerful routing at the expense of added complexity\n\n\nOpinionation\nFlexible opinionation. Gives a bit of flexibility to implement your own client-side stack.\nConsiderably less opinionated. This makes development simpler, as you don\u2019t have much cognitive overhead.\nHigh degree of opinionation. Has stronger opinions about how an application should be built, makes a lot of assumptions about your application and how to get you to conform to its expectations.\n\n\nData binding\nTwo-way\nOne-way\nTwo-way\n\n\n\nDefine Your Needs and Make a Chosen Framework Shine Its Brightest\n\nDetermining which framework is right for you is simply a matter of evaluating your application\u2019s needs versus the strengths of each framework. It requires an in-depth knowledge of advantages and disadvantages of each framework under consideration, and how they compete for different use cases. All the frameworks have a lot in common: they are open-sourced, released under the permissive license, and create SPAs with MVC design pattern. They all have views, events, data modules and routing. However, different JavaScript frameworks are better suitable for different types of applications.\nIf you are making a decision on creating a web app, Angular, React, and Ember are safest bet for a long-term support and active communities. Moreover, currently Angular is the most popular of these three. You can use it as one-stop-shop. It\u2019s a framework of choice for large enterprises. Ember is the best solution for those who seek for all-tools-included framework approach. Ember makes many decisions instead of you, so you don\u2019t have to spend your time on researching and gluing together libraries. As Ember takes long to learn, it would suit well for long-term project. React is the lightest weight of the named above. It does one thing great: renders UI components. Many even pair it with the above-mentioned frameworks. It\u2019s an appropriate choice if you need to gradually modernize an existing code base.\nAs you see, there is no clear winner. Some frameworks fit specific projects better than the others do. Examine your project from several different perspectives including maturity, size, dependencies, interoperability, features, etc., and contact professional front-end web development company to build immaculate website architecture and website design that suit your business needs the best.\n\n\n\nTopics:\n\njavascript,\nember.js,\nreact.js,\nangular.js,\nweb dev\n\n\n\nPublished at DZone with permission of Nataliia Bubniuk.\n                      \nSee the original article here.\n                          \n\n\n\nOpinions expressed by DZone contributors are their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Comments\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Web Dev Partner Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nAbout DZone\nSend feedback\nCareers\n\n\n\nADVERTISE\n\nDeveloper\n                            Marketing Blog\nAdvertise with DZone\n+1 (919) 238-7100\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTRIBUTE ON DZONE\n\nMVB Program\nBecome a Contributor\nVisit the Writers' Zone\n\nLEGAL\n\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nCONTACT US\n\n600 Park Offices Drive\nSuite 150\nResearch Triangle Park, NC 27709\nsupport@dzone.com\n+1 (919) 678-0300\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's be friends:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDZone.com is powered by\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

Every project manager does.\n\nNo wonder, as scope creep is one of the primary causes of project failure. Thousands, if not millions of project managers become victims of scope creep every year, too late to realize there are missing parts in their project equation.\nIn fact, Forecast's survey has shown that 71% of all tasks are created after the project start date!\nBut to every problem, there\u2019s a solution. In this short guide, we\u2019ll show you a few simple steps on how to prevent and control scope creep.\u00a0\n\nWhat is scope creep?\nTop causes of scope creep in project management\nHow to avoid scope creep in 4 steps\nManaging project scope creep with pricing\n\n\nWhat is scope creep?\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. Scope creep, by definition, is nothing more than the new unexpected requirements brought to the table by stakeholders after all the sides have agreed on a certain project scope.\nPMBOK defines scope creep as the phenomenon of \u201cadding features and functionality to the project scope without taking into account the effects it can have on time, costs, and resources.\u201d In other words, scope creep is extra work that you did not initially plan to do, and work that is not reflected or included in the agreed scope of the project.\u00a0\nAs mentioned by Mike Clayton, a leading expert in the domain of project management, scope creep may start with only three words \u201cCould you just\u2026?\u201d, and have a dramatic impact on the project in the end. It\u2019s because what occurs during scope creep are changes to the project that are not within the approved budget or time.\nThis usually can't just be taken lightly. Having a high level of scope creep can significantly increase the risk of the project going off-track, over budget, or often over time. This puts stress on yourself, your fellow colleagues, and the business that is paying your bills.\nSo when the project is growing in scale with brand new requests coming in, but resources aren\u2019t, you might be experiencing the first signs of scope creep. This is when your project is slowly getting out of control.\nAn extreme example of scope creep would be a bridge across the river that turns up to be a boat in the end. But usually, little things just snowball into something veering from the original client expectations.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTop causes of scope creep in project management\nCommon causes for scope creep can include poor communications, sparsely defined requirements, missing documentation, lack of control over changes, and long projects, among other things. Let's take a look at each.\n1. Poor communications\nWhen the original time and budget estimates are not met, in most cases, something must have gone wrong on your communication fronts. There are two common scenarios:\n\nYour team has been approached by the client and asked to make a \u2018few\u2019 changes to the scope without you knowing it.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ve failed to communicate project requirements to the team and thus let the project slide in the unknown direction.\u00a0\n\nRead on how to fix these later in the article.\u00a0\n2. Sparsely defined requirements\nIn addition to inconsistent communications, scope creep is generally a direct result of poorly defined requirements. The unclear scope from the beginning can\u2019t lead to a meaningful result. Often this happens when the team is denied to take the time needed to collect and define detailed requirements. Everyone ends up with a fuzzy understanding of the project and their own hidden agenda of what needs to be done.\u00a0\n3. Missing documentation\nOne of the reasons you may be experiencing project scope creep is the lack of a single source of truth for the teams, clients, you, and all stakeholders in general, to rely on. Lacking the statement of work and depth in the specification document, your project will turn into a center of ideas rather than clearly defined objectives.\u00a0\n4. Lack of control over changes\nScope creep can also easily sneak up on you if you don't pay close attention to your project. It often begins with minor changes or feedback from your client, and then suddenly it turns into several days or weeks of extra work. Mind you, the original scope of the project did not include that additional work. Especially if you work with fixed price projects, and you did not agree to bill your client for those extra hours, it's quite frankly going to affect your bottom line; not to mention the profitability of the project. How frustrating!\u00a0\n5. Long projects\nLonger projects are associated with scope creep not only because accurate predictions are out of reach, but also because stakeholders have more time to refine their ideas. Couple it with constant comparisons with the competition or business changes, happening alongside the project. So the longer the project runs, the higher the chances of scope creep are.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHow to avoid scope creep\nClearly, project managers have many challenges to address when it comes to project scope creep. But there are as many solutions and prevention tactics that end the nightmare. Try to keep them in mind for your next project.\n\u00a0\n1. Make a clearly defined statement of work\nTo avoid those long drawn out projects, you need an adequately defined Statement of Work (SOW).\nThe SOW should function as a detailed building plan and roadmap of what has to be done on a project. It should be as specific as possible. A SOW should include the preparations necessary for every role working on each task within the project. This way you avoid the potential risk of the client wanting one thing, you understanding a second, and the assigned person building something else.\nMainly, if you don\u2019t have an agreed SOW with a clear description - each link (client, designer, developer, etc.) might understand the project differently, and thus ending up with something completely different, like in this famous scope creep meme.\u00a0\n\nSource\n\u00a0\nWe've probably all seen this scenario before. This picture perfectly exemplifies what causes scope creep and how projects quickly spin out of control. The building plan, SOW, was not correctly described by the client to the project manager at the very beginning. Further through the production timeline, it is clear how the project was not going to be the ideal result.\u00a0\nIn the end, the product was not anywhere close to what the client envisioned and needed in the first place. If you can't refer back to your mutually signed SOW, then those corrections could quickly turn out to be much more comprehensive. In result, it could make the project run overtime, stretch your resources, and push other projects and clients further from their completion dates.\u00a0\nMake sure you understand the idea and expectations of your client. Together with your client, brainstorm the idea, define the requirements, and carefully create the SOW. Build a proposal around the SOW, and mutually sign both pieces, i.e., SOW and Proposal.\n\n\u00a0\nNow, with a mutually agreed SOW and Proposal, you're ready to move forward with the planning phase of the project. With the outcome in mind, you both know what's within the scope, what's out of reach, and specifically what needs to be built or created.\u00a0\nUse the SOW both internally with your teams, and externally with your client to keep everybody on the same page. You can always refer back to the initial SOW whenever your client is suggesting new features or some changes. For a profitable project, you need to agree and bill your client for any extra work put forth.\n\u00a0\n2. Assume there will be change\nProject scope is never set in stone. Change happens even before the ink is dry, regardless of how detailed your scope and requirements are. What you can do from the beginning is learn how to embrace the mindset of change and live with it in harmony.\u00a0\nWhenever there\u2019s the case for change, your job is to control requests for change, manage the process, and ensure there's good governance. Every change should be supported by the evidence of need, so make sure it is of value to the project. Change management processes have to be set up upfront and you probably already have these in place. But if you don\u2019t, think and develop possible scenarios on how you\u2019ll respond to change. Here are a few critical steps not to miss:\u00a0\n\n\nLog changes. Changes should not go unnoticed. Make sure you keep a record of every additional requirement to the scope, so it\u2019s easier to report to the client and ask for additional resources when necessary.\u00a0\nRe-plan. Keeping your baseline up-to-date can help you communicate project progress and lack of resources, among other things.\u00a0\nRequest additional funding. If you follow the two above steps, you have solid proof for requesting additional funding or resources from your client.\u00a0\n\n\nMany of us would feel frustrated with even the smallest changes, as that means that the initial project plan we\u2019ve put together with the project schedule, can easily go to waste. Remember that well-prepared project managers have the right tools and aim higher than another spreadsheet, so they can react to change fast by quickly re-planning their baselines and being able to tell how changes will affect their resources, deadlines, and budgets. Forecast\u2019s Auto Schedule, for example, creates a simulation where you can accommodate changes in your plan without losing control over how it influences your project. Watch a video here to learn more:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n3. Educate your clients\nTo prevent scope creep, set up discovery sessions with your clients in the early stages even before the project begins and develop processes and strategies around change requests.\nLetting the clients in on your processes and agreeing what\u2019s best for both sides is essential to your success and future collaboration. Make sure everybody is\u00a0on the same page when it comes to change management.\u00a0\nWhen you move further into the execution phase of the project, set up weekly status meetings to keep everyone in the loop about what\u2019s happening. Also, confirm that everyone\u2019s definition of change is the same across all touchpoints. Now, on to the next tip, it will help you better identify the meaning of change.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4. Filter simple adjustments from new tasks\nThis one is very specific and critical for both avoiding scope creep and not becoming a control freak. Whenever you receive feedback on your project deliverables, make sure to distinguish the input from what is a simple adjustment to your work from an entirely new task. Adjustments can be alright, of course, but new tasks are most often out of the initially defined scope.\nThe difference is in what the client is asking to have changed. An adjustment is a simple change to adapt the experience slightly, i.e., the design of a button in a mobile app. A new task is if the nature of this button is asked to be changed, i.e., creating an entirely new flow or building a new feature around it.\nSuggestions and feature requests can be alright, but significant changes need to result in an extended agreement. Of course, this is in the case that the feature or change is clearly out of the scope and not just a simple adjustment of the current project. If it is indeed a new task, say something like, \u2018We can definitely do that, but this is out of the initially agreed scope of the project. Would you like me to do an estimation of the time and costs for you?\u2019. In this way, you are open to the adjustment but are also making sure that your project remains profitable.\n\n\u00a0\nForecast has a simple flow built in to cater for this approval process. You can easily add new tasks to your SOW during the project. The tasks will stay as suggestions until a further approval process has taken place. You can add detailed information to the job, by entering a low and high estimate. You immediately get a more accurate time frame and price to propose to your client. If agreed, you can move the new task(s) into a new or current milestone, and approve the task for production.\n\u00a0\nBonus tips: Watch out for signs & track your time\nOften, how your team behaves and completes tasks can warn you and help you avoid scope creep! First off, learn what your team is doing. What are your team\u2019s project accomplishments? Are things too quiet? Is everything OK every time you ask? Too much of quietness or affirmations can serve as a wake up call that something\u2019s not right.\nAnother thing that helps to avoid scope creep is time tracking. Timesheets shed light on where your team\u2019s time is going and allow you to tell if the project is on time and on budget. Off topic, if you foster a time registration discipline, your employees will also be able to revisit their own productivity and improve work-life balance.\n\nTo manage projects, resources, time, and budget successfully, you\u2019ll need one full-suite command center. Forecast\u2019s complete solution is a go-to, as it arms you with all the necessary tools to button up every project stage.\nWith all tasks in one place, complete with all the information you need, i.e., descriptions, subtasks, assigned people, time entries, design files, comments, and so forth, you can evaluate if the project goes according to your plan and focus on the bottlenecks too.\nA proper project management solution should be able to store everything related to the project and each task in one place, giving your team a place to get the one-truth, and thus a place to refer back to if any questions arise. Project management solution helps your team with being able to communicate in the right context if the task is going through several hands along the way.\n\u00a0\n\nManaging project scope creep with pricing\nEvery year, project scope creep is eating up millions from the companies\u2019 bottom lines. The pricing model you choose for the project might be the reason for that. Traditional fixed price projects won\u2019t give you much flexibility with change requests, so a work around could be retainer pricing, a more agile approach to both project management and finances. Here\u2019s our guide on how to introduce retainer pricing if you\u2019re interested in more predictable revenue models.\u00a0\nNow, completely avoiding scope creep can be tricky, but following the steps above can greatly improve your chances of detecting potential loopholes early. No matter, whether they arise from an unclear SOW or your client trying to, maybe unintentionally, adding extra work to your agreed scope - avoiding scope creep is paramount.\nTry Forecast to experience how easy you can get an overview and understanding of your project's progress.\n\n\u00a0\nContinue reading other articles related to this subject:\n\n10 Steps to Make a Complete Statement of Work\nThe Old vs. the Smart Way of Doing Statement of Work\nUtilizing the Statement of Work During Your Project\n9 Steps to Plan Your Way Out of Scope Creep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Great Offer, Just a Click Away\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Story\n\u2190 How to Make a Complete Statement of Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Story\nThe Most Desirable Project Management Skills in 2020 \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou May Also Like\nThese Stories on Project & Resource Management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject & Resource Management\n\n\n\n\n\nAgile vs Waterfall: What's Best for Your Projects, Clients & Business?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 14, 2020 10:49:05 AM | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    16 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject & Resource Management\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Steps to Managing a Digital Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 26, 2020 3:44:28 PM | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    5 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject & Resource Management\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Best and Worst Parts of Being a Project Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 20, 2020 3:18:53 PM | \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    12 min read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Forecast Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtboard 1\n\n\nValkendorfsgade 13\n1151 Copenhagen\nDenmark\nVAT: DK 3801 9651\n+45 61 77 97 22\n\n33 Foley St\nFitzrovia\nLondon W1W 7TL\nUnited Kingdom\nVAT: UK 1228 8765\n\ninfo@forecast.app\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9  Forecast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\n\nPlatform Overview\nAI Work Automation\nProject Management\nResource Management\nTeam Collaboration\nProject Accounting\nBusiness Intelligence\nPricing\nApps & Integrations\nStart Free Trial\nLogin to Forecast\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\nAgencies\nConsulting\nSoftware\nProject Management\nOperations\nFinance\n\n\n\nForecast\n\nAbout Us\nReviews\nPress\nInvestors\nCareers\nContact\nStatus\n\n\n\nResources\n\nCustomer Stories\nBlog\nWebinars\nHelp Center\nFull Feature List\nBook a Demo\nDevelopers API\n\n\n\nLegal\n\nSecurity\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nGDPR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

Instead of getting overwhelmed by this wealth of options, learn the highlights of each and make an informed choice for your business. With this knowledge, you can understand the lingo other managers use, analyze their methods, and emulate their best practices!                 Waterfall Project Management     Many businesses use the Waterfall Method, the simplest way to plan a project. Tasks flow down the list in sequential order, just like a waterfall. In this basic system, a team must complete one step before starting the next. Managers find this system very straightforward and easy-to-implement. Just make a list of the steps you need to accomplish a deliverable item and get to work! Team members can quickly understand waterfall processes, saving project managers valuable communication time. More managers use the Waterfall system than any other, especially in the construction and software development industries. Business leaders have created many varieties of this PM methodology, but remain consistent with these general components:  Specification of Consumer Requirements Concept, Design, and Planning Creation of a Physical Product (Construction, Coding, etc.) Integration into Current Systems Validation (Testing, Debugging, etc.) Product Installation Ongoing Maintenance  The Waterfall method best suits teams in manufacturing and construction that create physical products and follow precise assembly orders. They can easily copy plans from previous projects and apply them to their current work with little or no adjustment. Teams that need to change their plans as their projects progress, however, will find this method quite limiting.              Critical Path Method (CPM)     Management experts created the CPM project management methodology over a half-century ago to highlight tasks that teams can\u2019t begin until finishing others. For example, construction workers find it best to install toilets and light fixtures only after plumbers and electricians have run pipes and wires through the walls. And, of course, they save drywall and painting for last. CPM managers make strings of tasks that each depend on the other. These sequential items form a team\u2019s critical path. For example, once workers have laid a foundation and raised the frame of a house, they can conduct a number of non-dependent tasks: plumbing, electric, cabinetry, etc. However, carpet installers should wait until everyone else has finished their tasks and left the house clean and dust-free. By determining a critical path and focusing on these important tasks above all others, managers can avoid frustrating bottlenecks. They can allocate more resources to any items on a critical path that lag behind and threaten delays. With the CPM, managers can pull workers from non-essential tasks when they need to \u201cunkink\u201d the chain of events in their critical path. Because workers can complete non-essential tasks at any time, the company can continue working at a normal pace, despite changes in worker allocation.         Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)     Managers use the CCPM methodology (an extension of CPM) to prioritize critical resources. Though contractors on projects like home-building often run the risk of certain teams waiting for others to finish, they must also time out the delivery of critical supplies. For example, a team leader might delay an order with a concrete company if they experience delays while digging a foundation. If the cement workers were to arrive and there was no place to pour concrete, they would have to dump their loads or risk its setting inside their trucks! To avoid bottlenecks and disruptions in the ordering of resources, managers put time buffers around critical tasks. Though this slows down project completion slightly, it dramatically reduces their risks of expensive resource re-orders. These buffered tasks form a \u201ccritical chain\u201d of the most sensitive tasks on a critical path. Instead of getting overwhelmed by this wealth of options,earn the highlights of each and make an informed choice for your business.              Agile Project Management     A group of software development experts developed the basics of the Agile System just over 15 years ago. They created a new way to deliver value to and interact with consumers that featured four key aspects:  Project managers must value individual interactions over systems and tools. Software should work well and not require extensive documentation. Teams and customers should collaborate, not haggle over contracts. Companies must prioritize responsiveness over rigid adherence to plans.  In just a short time, PM experts have expanded these concepts into many implementation frameworks, including:  Scrum Project Management Kanban Project Management Extreme Programming Adaptive Project Framework (APF)  Though the linear Waterfall PM strategy suits many organizations, managers in certain fields find it quite limiting. By planning only at the beginning of a project, they lose the benefit of the knowledge and experience they gain while completing it. Instead of creating detailed specifications for end products at the beginning of an endeavor, Agile managers only identify priorities. As their teams work towards their goals, these managers remain flexible, communicate with all stakeholders, and change product requirements whenever necessary. The Agile PM methodology suits businesses that seek to quickly and consistently provide products to consumers. Software development companies prefer this \u201clight-touch\u201d management style which facilitates rapid production cycles. With this system, team leaders can create responsive and transparent workplace cultures. By sharing responsibility with their team members, they can optimize their awareness of and reactivity to market trends and changes in demand. Agile teams work in short \u201csprints\u201d or burst of work. Team leaders quantify each of these sprints as small, deliverable units. Teams stay motivated by working on series of small, fast projects (such as software updates) and tracking their progress. Companies increase their responsiveness to customer demands and changes in the marketplace. Software companies, for example, create Agile teams to rapidly adjust their offerings to new challenges like emerging platforms and operating system updates.              Agile Project Management: Scrum     For those of you not raving rugby fans, a scrum is a tangle of heavy people who strain against each other to acquire a small, oblong, whitish ball. As business managers find such behavior undesirable in production teams, they employ the Scrum method of project management. Scrum teams meet for monthly Scrum sessions in which they break down their projects and deliverables into 15- or 30-day chunks, called \u201csprints.\u201d By working toward these small increments, teams avoid the process overwhelm typical of other PM methodologies. By re-prioritizing their efforts each month to meet consumer demand, they can stay flexible and motivated \u2013 increasing both productivity and customer satisfaction! Dev teams often apply the popular Scrum variation of Agile Project Management. Managers find Scrum easy to implement and very effective in addressing issues affecting software development teams. Team members enjoy the way Scrum helps them untangle complex development cycles, redefine end goals during a project cycle, and get quality products to market very quickly. In this system, no one holds the title of \u201cproject manager.\u201d Instead, they split up their responsibilities by taking on certain roles: ScrumMaster, product owner, and team member:  Scrum Master The ScrumMaster (despite their impressive-sounding title) does not take on the title of manager or team leader. This person oversees the Scrum process, not the job itself. They ensure everyone on the team communicates well on daily projects, eliminates distractions, and clears obstacles in the group\u2019s path.  Product Owner This person, either a key user or a marketing expert, gives the team a consistent vision of their initial goal: to meet customer needs. Because a team\u2019s concept of their end product can change as they work, the Product Owner performs a vital \u201cgrounding\u201d function. Team Member Teams meet daily to discuss their completed work and identify any roadblocks to further progress. The Scrum Master agrees to deal with these roadblocks; the Product Owner collaborates with the team to optimize product targeting. The Scrum Method works best for small teams that work together in one environment and focus on only one project at a time. It facilitates open communication and creativity, as well as rapid development/testing cycles. Scrum works especially well when teams have substantial support from upper management, in the form of open financial and time budgets.          Agile and Kanban: A Perfect Match     Originally developed by Toyota in the 1940s, Kanban means \u201csignal card\u201d in Japanese. This method relied on Kanban cards, which indicate the need to reorder certain supplies. Many managers consider Kanban a Lean Manufacturing system because it eliminates wasted time and resources. In short, Kanban makes companies \u201clean and mean.\u201d Many project managers use Kanban concepts in conjunction with Agile methods. The genius of Kanban is \u201con-demand\u201d production, in which customer orders \u201cpull\u201d items through a production facility. Get Toggl Track This idea replaces the traditional method of producing large amounts of products and warehousing them in anticipation of an estimated demand. In a software development setting, this idea of customer demand powering a system fits hand in glove with Agile. In the workplace, Kanban teams originally visualized their workflow as cards moving from left to right across a Kanban board. They grouped tasks and projects into broad categories:  In Queue (a U.K./Commonwealth term meaning \u201cin line\u201d) In Progress Recently Completed  Modern Agile/Kanban managers use virtual \u201ccards\u2019 to represent units of work flowing through their systems. By engaging visually with their workflow, team members and managers can easily estimate and prioritize upcoming tasks. When assigning new tasks (inspired by customer demand), executives use Kanban boards to assess a team\u2019s current workload. They can easily estimate the effects additional tasks would have on a team\u2019s current productivity. The Agile/Kanban hybrid project management methodology works best for small teams that work in a single, shared location. Even people who work independently find this PM method useful.         Agile Project Management: Extreme Programming (EP)     Like all Agile systems, Extreme Programming focuses on teamwork and customer satisfaction. It features five basic tenets:  Communication Simplicity Feedback Respect Courage  Extreme Programming teams work in shorter sprints typical for Agile/Scrum companies. These shorter cycles allow them to maintain rigid task structures. EP teams don\u2019t embrace as much flexibility as other Agile teams, undertaking tasks in a strict priority order. The EP methodology mandates specific engineering practices such as test-driven product development, automated testing, simple and elegant design, refactoring, etc. Experts recommend teams begin with Scrum and adopt EP slowly as they determine their own best practices and engineering protocols.         Agile Project Management: Adaptive Project Framework (APF)     The Adaptive Project Framework allows Agile teams to work with optimal flexibility and epitomize the idea of \u201cagility.\u201d Sometimes teams must improvise their systems and protocols as they work, due to roughly-defined goals and outcomes. The APF framework best suits unique challenges which don\u2019t call for one size fits all solutions. This approach empowers teams because they aren\u2019t expected to blindly follow pre-ordained scripts. In this model, clients work directly with Agile teams and select the exact features they need in finished products. Consumers appreciate not having to accept products that meet some, but not all, of their needs. Similarities between Agile Methodologies Regardless of the flavor of Agile you choose, they all share certain commonalities. Agile teams:  Maintain clear project objectives, though final product may change as they work. Work in iterative cycles, constantly evaluating their results. Optimize their deliverables to meet consumer needs. Collaborate continuously with each other, stakeholders, and customers.          Rapid Applications Development (RAD)     Another project management methodology preferred by software development teams, the Rapid Application Development model facilitates interaction via certain, structured techniques. RAD teams create prototypes to determine user needs and redefine their designs. They repeat this cycle many times throughout the development process to optimize product quality and user experience. RAD teams move quickly, putting off large design improvements to future production/software update cycles. These nimble organizations often re-use components of other software systems to focus on immediate customer demands. RAD managers focus on consumer data gathered from focus groups and workshops to rapidly deliver desirable products. The RAD method works best for teams that don\u2019t require long interactions and deep development of complex functions. RAD teams excel at light applications and rapid development cycles.         New Product Introduction (NPI)     Business leaders use the NPI methodology to focus on certain steps of a task, not the management of entire projects. For example, NPI teams don\u2019t spend time creating Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) and mapping out tasks and budget allocations across vast, complicated projects. Instead, they focus on communication with all stakeholders in a project \u2013 both inside and outside of an organization. The NPI project management strategy works best for product-based teams because NPI managers shepherd single products through their entire development process. These managers create teams from all sectors of an organization involved in creating a new product. With their teams, they guide and shape a product all the way through to its launch.         Packaged Enabled Reengineering (PER)     Project leaders use the PER project management methodology to redesign a product or system from the ground up. By taking a fresh look at a company\u2019s offerings and redesigning them completely, PER teams can shed outdated assumptions and organizational habits. PER managers help organizations stay true to their commitment to growth with regular reviews of the modification process. They create and maintain corporate cultures of innovation and help their colleagues let go of old ways of doing things. With the potent PER method, companies can change rapidly to address changes in consumer demand and maximize their returns on investment.          PRINCE2     Not to be confused with the PMBOK, the Project Management Institute\u2019s Project Management Body of Knowledge (a best-practices resource), PRINCE2 is a complete project methodology system. Used by the U.K. government and many private-sector organizations across the globe, PRINCE2 has much to offer U.S. organizations:  Greater Resource Control Increased Project Risk Management Clear and Structures Responsibility Allocation A focus on End-User \u201cWhos, Whens, and Whys\u201d Consistent, Organized Planning and Execution Regular Review Justification Cycles               Six Sigma     The Motorola company originally developed the highly-disciplined Six Sigma system to eliminate defects. They wanted their products and services to conform completely to their original specifications throughout the entire design, production, and delivery process. Some experts consider Six Sigma more of a quality-control and apparatus than a true project management methodology, due to its focus on gathering data and improving processes. Companies typically use this method to increase efficiency, raise productivity, and deliver uniform products to consumers. Six Sigma Managers use 5 process steps, collectively called DMAIC-S:  Define customer needs. By identifying and profiling ideal customers and understanding how to serve them, managers can shape the scope and purpose of a project. Measure the performance of a process. By creating appropriate metrics for gathering data on productivity, managers can determine how well a system meets consumer needs. Analyze common problems. Six Sigma managers examine performance gaps to determine their root causes and back up their observations with hard data. Improve systems. Executives design, test, and execute new systems to address the root causes of systemic problems. They continue to rely on data in their evaluations of these solutions (and the implementation of these fixes). Synergize these results throughout the company. Six Sigma managers know that changes to one area of operations affect all other parts of a business, to some degree. They share the experience and knowledge they have gained from an optimization cycle with their colleagues and supervisors.  Some managers follow the DMAIC method without employing the entire Six Sigma management strategy. They use this data-driven method to improve, optimize, and stabilize their designs, processes, and systems.         Outcome Mapping     The International Development Research Center (IDRC) developed the outcome mapping project management methodology. Many charitable organizations which bundle large donations into grants for developing countries use this system. With the Outcome Mapping PM methodology, charities can measure the effects of their efforts on secondary beneficiaries. They take care to ensure that the recipients of large grants create benefits for large groups of people and facilitate positive behavior changes. Organizations that use this PM methodology divide their tasks into two distinct phases:  Design\u2013 Project leaders write essays in which they identify their direct partners (governments and local organizations who receive funds) and indirect partners (people in need who receive benefits). They determine progress markers, appropriate actions for partners to take, and suitable metrics for later record-keeping. Record-Keeping \u2013 Outcome mapping organizations keep three types of journals: performance (meeting minutes and organizational progress), strategy (tasks completed in the overall plan), and outcomes (realization of stated goals and desired results).  Outcome mapping works best for groups that contribute to others instead of creating products and services. Organizations outside the philanthropy sector rarely use this PM methodology.         Project Management Institute (PMI)     Some, but not all, managers consider the PMI\u2019s Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) a PM methodology in its own right. Others consider it more of a reference book. Certainly, the PMBOK provides an essential set of conventions and standardizes the professional terms used by PM experts. Regardless of opinion, the PMI has influenced managers to break projects into five steps:  Initiation Planning Execution Controlling Closing          Project Management Software     Your tools must match your aims and strategies. Consider the following attributes of your current (and desired) PM software:  Multi-User Capacity (i.e. Can your entire team use it at once?) PM Functions That Mesh Well with your PM Methodology Reviews from Project Managers Who Share Your Corporate Philosophy Maximum Data Storage Capacities Reliability and Ease of Use Necessary Training/Transition Times Data-Based vs. Visual Interfaces Chart-Making and Workflow Tracking Tools  The companies that developed your PM software platform probably shaped it to suit a particular strategy. For example, RAD methodologies sync well with object-oriented programming languages like Java and C++. Services like MeisterTask and Trello offer interactive \u201cboards\u201d that mesh perfectly with Kanban corporate structures.

Choosing the right framework for your project can have a huge impact on your ability to deliver on time, and your ability to maintain your code in the future. You probably want a solid, stable and proven framework to build upon, but don't want to be limited by your choice. The web is evolving fast \u2014 new technologies arise, and old methodologies quickly become irrelevant. Under this light, we are going to go through an in-depth comparison of the three frameworks.\n##2  Meet The Frameworks\nAll the frameworks we are going to meet today have a lot in common: they are open-sourced, released under the permissive MIT license, and try to solve the problem of creating Single Page Web Applications using the MV* design pattern. They all have the concept of views, events, data models and routing. We are going to start with some quick background and history, and then dive in to compare the three frameworks.\nAngularJS was born in 2009 as a part of a larger commercial product, called GetAngular. Shortly after, Misko Hevery, one of the engineers who founded GetAngular, managed to recreate a web application that consisted of 17 thousand lines of code and took 6 months to develop in a mere 3 weeks using just GetAngular. Reducing the size of the application to just about 1,000 lines of code convinced Google to start sponsoring the project, turning it into the open-source AngularJS we know today. Amongst Angular's unique and innovative features are two-way data bindings, dependency injection, easy-to-test code and extending the HTML dialect by using directives.\nBackbone.js is a lightweight MVC framework. Born in 2010, it quickly grew popular as a lean alternative to heavy, full-featured MVC frameworks such as ExtJS. This resulted in many services adopting it, including Pinterest, Flixster, AirBNB and others. \nEmber's roots go way back to 2007. Starting its life as the SproutCore MVC framework, originally developed by SproutIt and later by Apple, it was forked in 2011 by Yehuda Katz, a core contributor to the popular jQuery and Ruby on Rails projects. Notable Ember users include Yahoo!, Groupon, and ZenDesk.\n##3 Community\nCommunity is one of the most important factors to consider when choosing a framework. A large community means more questions answered, more third-party modules, more YouTube tutorials\u2026you get the point. I have put together a table with the numbers, as of June 30, 2015. Angular is definitely the winner here, being the 3rd most-starred project on GitHub and having more questions on StackOverflow than Ember and Backbone combined, as you can see below:\n\n\n\nMetric\nAngularJS\nBackbone.js\nEmber.js\n\n\n \nStars on Github\n40.2k\n18.8k\n14.1k\n\n\nThird-Party Modules\n1488 ngmodules\n256 backplugs\n1155 emberaddons\n\n\nStackOverflow Questions\n104k\n18.2k\n15.7k\n\n\nYouTube Results\n~93k\n~10.6k\n~9.1k\n\n\nGitHub Contributors\n96\n265\n501\n\n\nChrome Extension Users\n275k\n15.6k\n66k\n\n\nOpen Issues\n922\n13\n413\n\n\nClosed Issues\n5,520\n2,062\n3,350\n \n\nAll those metrics, however, merely show the current state of each framework. It is also interesting to see which framework has a faster-growing popularity. Fortunately, using Google Trends we can get an answer for that too:\n\n##4 Framework Size\nPage load times are crucial for the success of your web site. Users do not exhibit much patience when it comes to the speed of browsing \u2014 so in many cases it is desired to do everything possible to make your application load as fast as possible. There are two factors to look at when considering the impact of the framework on the loading time of your application: framework size and the time it takes the framework to bootstrap. \nJavascript assets are usually served minified and gzipped, so we are going to compare the size of the minified-gzipped versions. However, merely looking at the framework is not enough. Backbone.js, despite being the smallest (only 6.5kb), requires both Underscore.js (5kb) and jQuery (32kb) or Zepto (9.1kb), and you will probably need to add some third party plug-ins to the mix.\n\n\n\nFramework\nNet Size\nSize with required dependencies\n\n\n\n\nAngularJS 1.2.22\n39.5kb\n39.5kb\n\n\nBackbone.js 1.1.2\n6.5kb\n43.5kb (jQuery + Underscore)\n          20.6kb (Zepto + Underscore)\n        \n\n\nEmber.js 1.6.1\n90kb\n136.2kb (jQuery + Handlebars)\n\n\n\n##5 Templating\nAngular and Ember include a template engine. Backbone, on the other hand, leaves it up to you to use the template engine of your choice. The best way to get a feeling of the different templating engines is a code sample, so let's dive in. We will show an example of formatting a list of items as HTML.\n###5.1 AngularJS\nAngular's Templating engine is simply HTML with binding expressions baked-in. Binding expressions are surrounded by double curly braces: \n\n<ul> \n    <li ng-repeat=\"framework in frameworks\" title=\"{{framework.description}}\">               \n                  {{framework.name}} \n    </li> \n</ul>\n###5.2 Backbone.js\nWhile Backbone can be integrated with many third-party template engines, the default choice is Underscore templates. Since Underscore is a Backbone dependency and you already have it on your page, you can easily take advantage of its templating engine without adding any additional dependencies for your application. On the downside, the templating engine of Underscore is very basic and you usually have to throw javascript into the mix, as you can see in our example:\n\n<ul> \n    <% _.each(frameworks, function(framework) { %> \n        <li title=\"<%- framework.description %>\"> \n            <%- framework.name %> \n        </li> \n    <% }); %> \n</ul>\n###5.3 Ember.js\nEmber currently uses the Handlebars template engine, which is an extension to the popular Mustache templating engine. A new Handlebars variant, called HTMLBars is currently in the works. Handlebars does not understand DOM - all it does is a simple string transformation. HTMLBars will understand DOM, so the variable interpolation will be context aware. As HTMLBars is still not production-ready, we will show the Handlebars way of printing the framework list:\n\n<ul> \n    {{#each frameworks}} \n        <li {{bind-attr title=description}}> \n            {{name}} \n        </li> \n    {{/each}} \n</ul>\n##6 AngularJS\n###6.1 The Good Parts\nAngular has brought many innovative concepts to the world of web developers. Two-way data binding saves a lot of boilerplate code. Consider the following jQuery code snippet:\n\n$('#greet-form input.user-name').on('value', function() { \n    $('#greet-form div.user-name').text('Hello ' + this.val() + '!'); \n});\nThanks to Angular's two-way-binding, you never have to write this code yourself. Rather, you just declare the bindings in your HTML template:\n\n<input ng-model=\"user.name\" type=\"text\" />\nHello {{user.name}}!\nPromises play a main role in the Angular cast. Javascript is a single-thread, event-loop based language, which implies that many operations (such as network communication) happen in an asynchronous manner. Asynchronous javascript code tends to grow quickly into a spaghetti of nested callbacks, better recognized as \"Pyramid Code\" or \"Callback Hell.\"\nNot only does Angular have the largest community and much more online content than the two others, it is also backed and promoted by Google. As such, the core team is constantly growing, resulting in innovation and tools that improve developer productivity: Protractor, Batarang, ngmin and Zone.js, just to name a few. In addition, the team collaborates with the community on the design decisions. For example, all the design documents for Angular 2.0 can be found here, and everyone can make suggestions directly to the design documents.\nAngular helps you categorize your application building blocks into several types: Controllers, Directives, Factories, Filters, Services and Views (templates). Those are organized in turn into modules, which can depend one upon the other. Each type of building block has a different role. Views do the UI, Controllers work out the logic behind the UI, Services take care of communication with the backend and hold together pieces of common and related functionality, while Directives make it easy to create reusable components and extending HTML by defining new elements, attributes and behaviors.\nThe automatic Dirty Checking means that you don't have to access your model data with getters and setters \u2014 you can modify any property of an arbitrary scope object and angular will automatically detect the change and notify all the watchers for that property.\n\"Angular is written with testability in mind.\" This quote from the unit-testing guide has a lot behind it - Angular indeed puts a lot of emphasis on separation of concerns, unit isolation and provides ready-to-use, powerful mocks for fundamental built-in services such as $http and $timeout. \n###6.2 Pain Points\nAngular is often criticized for the complexity of the Directives API. Transclusion, in particular, is a concept which confuses many developers and wrapping your head around all the concepts such as compiling function, pre/post linking functions, the different scope kinds (transclusion/isolate/child scope) and all the other configuration settings for directives takes some time to master.\nThe scope hierarchy in Angular uses Prototypal Inheritance, which is a new concept to grasp for people coming from Object Oriented languages such as Java and C#. Failing to understand scope inheritance causes many cases of frustrated developers (examples: here, here and here).\nAngular Expressions are used extensively in the View layer of Angular. This expression language is very powerful, sometimes too powerful. It lets the developer use complicated logic and even perform assignment operations and calculations, all inside the view templates. Putting logic inside the templates makes it harder to test, as it becomes impossible to test it in isolation.  Consider the following code example, which clearly shows how easily the template language can be abused: \n\n<button ng-click=\"(oldPassword && checkComplexity(newPassword) && oldPassword != newPassword) ? (changePassword(oldPassword, newPassword) && (oldPassword=(newPassword=''))) : (errorMessage='Please input a new password matching the following requirements: ' + passwordRequirements)\">Click me</button>\nIn many cases, mistakes such as misspelling a directive name or calling an undefined scope function are silently ignored and can be challenging to find, especially when you throw into the mix the complexity of the directive API and the scope inheritance mentioned above. I have seen developers spending hours scratching their head trying to figure out why an event binding didn't fire the callback function on the scope, only to find out they have used the camelCase convention instead of the hyphen-separated one when spelling attribute names (example here).\nFinally, the Digest Cycle of angular, which takes care of the \"Magical\" dirty checking, has the tendency to surprise developers. It is easy to forget to call $digest() when running in non-Angular context (example). On the other hand, you have to be very careful not to cause slow watches or infinite digest loops (examples: here, here and here). In general, for pages with a lot of interactive elements, Angular becomes really slow. A good rule of thumb is not to have more than 2,000 active bindings on the same page. \n##7 Backbone.js\n###7.1 The Good Parts\nBackbone is lightweight, fast and has a small memory footprint. The learning curve is very linear, and there are only a few simple concepts to grasp (Models/Collections, Views, Routes). It has great documentation, the code is simple and heavily documented, and there is even an annotated version of the code which explains how it works in detail. You can actually go over the entire source code of the framework and get familiar with it in less than an hour.\nBeing so small and basic, Backbone can be a good foundation to build your own framework upon. Some examples of 3rd party frameworks based on Backbone are Aura, Backbone UI, Chaplin, Geppetto, Marionette, LayoutManager, Thorax, Vertebrae. With Angular and Ember you usually have to live with the choices made by the authors of the frameworks, which may or may not suit your project needs and personal style. Angular 2.0 promises to change it, by comprising small independent modules, so you will be able to pick and mix. We are yet to see if they will be able to deliver this.\n###7.2 Pain Points\nBackbone does not provide structure. It rather provides some basic tools you can use to create structure, leaving it up to the developer to decide how to structure his application, and there are also many blanks to fill. Things such as memory management have to be carefully considered. The lack of view lifecycle management makes route/state changes prone to memory leaks unless you take care of cleaning up everything yourself.\nWhile it is true that many of the functions not provided by Backbone itself could be filled by third-party plugins, this also means that there are many choices to be made when creating an application, as many functions have several alternative plugins. For example, nested models can be provided by Backbone.DocumentModel, BackBone.NestedTypes, Backbone.Schema, Backbone-Nested, backbone-nestify, just to name a few. Deciding which one is the best for your project requires research, which in turn takes time \u2014 and one of the main purposes of framework is to save you time.\nBackbone lacks support for two-way data binding, meaning you will have to write a lot of boilerplate to update the view whenever your model changes, and to update your model whenever the view changes. See the example given above, showing how two-way in Angular.js data binding reduces boilerplate.\nViews in Backbone manipulate the DOM directly, making them really hard to unit-test, more fragile and less reusable. The common practice is to look up DOM elements using CSS selectors, so changing a CSS class name, adding a new element with the same class name or even wrapping some DOM tree inside another element can break your CSS selectors and render your app unusable.\n##8 Ember.js\n###8.1 The Good Parts\nEmber.js favors Convention over Configuration. This means that instead of writing a lot of boilerplate code, Ember can automatically infer much of the configuration itself, such as automatically determining the name of the route and the controller when defining a router resource. Ember even raises the bar by automatically creating the controller for your resource if you don't define one yourself. \nEmber includes both an excellent router and an optional data layer, called ember data. Unlike the two other frameworks, which have a very minimal data layer (Backbone's Collection/Model and Angular's $resource), Ember comes out of the box with a fully-fledged data module which integrates really nicely with a Ruby-on-Rails backend or any other RESTful JSON API that follows a simple set of conventions. It also provides support for setting up fixtures for developing against mock API and testing.\nPerformance has been a major goal in the design of Ember.js. Concepts such as The Run Loop, which ensures that updated data only causes a single DOM update even if the same piece of data was updated several times, along with caching of computed properties, and the ability to precompile the HandleBars templates during the build time or on your server, help to keep your application load and run fast.\n###8.2 Pain Points\nEmber's API changed much before it stabilized. Therefore, there is a lot of outdated content and examples that no longer work, making it confusing for developers who are making their first steps in the framework. Take a look at the Ember Data Changelog, and you will see what I mean. There are so many breaking changes, and those cause many StackOverflow answers and coding tutorials to become irrelevant (example here).\nHandlebars pollutes the DOM with many <script> tags which it uses as markers to keep the templates up to date with your model. This will be gone with the transition to HTMLBars, but for the time being, your DOM tree will be filled up with so many <script> tags you will barely be able to recognize your own code. And the worst part - this can also break your CSS styling or integration with other frameworks, such as jQuery UI's Sortable.\n##9 Summary\nWe have seen the strengths and weaknesses of all the three frameworks. Ember's holistic approach which embraces MVC structure will make a lot of sense for developers who have a MVC programming background in Ruby, Python, Java, C# or any other Object Oriented language. Ember also brings application performance to the table,  and excels at saving you from writing boilerplate by favoring convention over configuration. \nBackbone embraces minimalism. It is small, fast and easy to learn, and provides the minimum (or in many cases, even less than the minimum) that you need to get going.\nAngular's innovative approach for extending HTML will make a lot of sense for people who are web developers in soul. With a large community and Google behind it, it is here to stay and grow, and it works well both for quick prototyping projects and large-scale production applications. \nCREDITS: Many thanks to Oren Rubin, Shai Reznik and Leon Fedotov who helped with this post.\nCREDITS: Many thanks to Oren Rubin, Shai Reznik and Leon Fedotov who helped with this post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged under\njavascriptangularjsbackbone.jsember.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar posts All posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njavascript\nnode.js\nredis\ncaching\n\n        A short description of strategy used for caching data and queries in a distributed application using Redis.\n      \n\n\n2 x\n\nFaster Responses - Data and Query Caching using Redis\n\nshivang doshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nangularjs\njavascript\ncss\ncss-transitions\n\n        Guide on using anchored CSS transitions to move elements between ng-repeat generated lists\n      \n\n\n4 x\n\nAnimating elements moving between AngularJS lists\n\nMichal Charemza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njavascript\n\n        This article identifies several types of stress that developers face on a daily basis and explains how they may impact effectiveness.

Watch it together with the written tutorial to deepen your understanding: Working With Python Virtual Environments\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll show you how to use virtual environments to create and manage separate environments for your Python projects, each using different versions of Python for execution. We\u2019ll also take a look at how Python dependencies are stored and resolved.\nFree Bonus: Click here to get access to a free 5-day class that shows you how to avoid common dependency management issues with tools like Pip, PyPI, Virtualenv, and requirements files.\n\nUpdated 2018-01-12: Clarified pyenv vs. venv usage on Python 3.6+\nUpdated 2016-06-11: Added section on changing Python versions with virtualenv\n\nWhy the Need for Virtual Environments?\nPython, like most other modern programming languages, has its own unique way of downloading, storing, and resolving packages (or modules). While this has its advantages, there were some interesting decisions made about package storage and resolution, which has lead to some problems\u2014particularly with how and where packages are stored.\nThere are a few different locations where these packages can be installed on your system. For example, most system packages are stored in a child directory of the path stored in sys.prefix.\nOn Mac OS X, you can easily find where sys.prefix points to using the Python shell:\n>>>>>> import sys\n>>> sys.prefix\n'/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5'\n\nMore relevant to the topic of this article, third party packages installed using easy_install or pip are typically placed in one of the directories pointed to by site.getsitepackages:\n>>>>>> import site\n>>> site.getsitepackages()\n[\n  '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/Extras/lib/python',\n  '/Library/Python/3.5/site-packages'\n]\n\nSo, why do all of these little details matter?\nIt\u2019s important to know this because, by default, every project on your system will use these same directories to store and retrieve site packages (third party libraries). At first glance, this may not seem like a big deal, and it isn\u2019t really, for system packages (packages that are part of the standard Python library), but it does matter for site packages.\nConsider the following scenario where you have two projects: ProjectA and ProjectB, both of which have a dependency on the same library, ProjectC. The problem becomes apparent when we start requiring different versions of ProjectC. Maybe ProjectA needs v1.0.0, while ProjectB requires the newer v2.0.0, for example.\nThis is a real problem for Python since it can\u2019t differentiate between versions in the site-packages directory. So both v1.0.0 and v2.0.0 would reside in the same directory with the same name:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/Extras/lib/python/ProjectC\n\nSince projects are stored according to just their name, there is no differentiation between versions. Thus, both projects, ProjectA and ProjectB, would be required to use the same version, which is unacceptable in many cases.\nThis is where virtual environments and the virtualenv/venv tools come into play\u2026\n    Remove adsWhat Is a Virtual Environment?\nAt its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.\nIn our little example above, we\u2019d just need to create a separate virtual environment for both ProjectA and ProjectB, and we\u2019d be good to go. Each environment, in turn, would be able to depend on whatever version of ProjectC they choose, independent of the other.\nThe great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since they\u2019re just directories containing a few scripts. Plus, they\u2019re easily created using the virtualenv or pyenv command line tools.\nUsing Virtual Environments\nTo get started, if you\u2019re not using Python 3, you\u2019ll want to install the virtualenv tool with pip:\n$ pip install virtualenv\n\nIf you are using Python 3, then you should already have the venv module from the standard library installed.\n\nNote: From here on out, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re using the newer venv tool, since there are few differences between it and virtualenv with regard to the actual commands. In reality, though, they are very different tools.\n\nStart by making a new directory to work with:\n$ mkdir python-virtual-environments && cd python-virtual-environments\n\nCreate a new virtual environment inside the directory:\n# Python 2:\n$ virtualenv env\n\n# Python 3\n$ python3 -m venv env\n\n\nNote: By default, this will not include any of your existing site packages.\n\nThe Python 3 venv approach has the benefit of forcing you to choose a specific version of the Python 3 interpreter that should be used to create the virtual environment. This avoids any confusion as to which Python installation the new environment is based on.\nFrom Python 3.3 to 3.4, the recommended way to create a virtual environment was to use the pyvenv command-line tool that also comes included with your Python 3 installation by default. But on 3.6 and above, python3 -m venv is the way to go.\nIn the above example, this command creates a directory called env, which contains a directory structure similar to this:\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 bin\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 activate\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 activate.csh\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 activate.fish\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 easy_install\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 easy_install-3.5\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pip\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pip3\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 pip3.5\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 python -> python3.5\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 python3 -> python3.5\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 python3.5 -> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3.5\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 include\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 python3.5\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 site-packages\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 pyvenv.cfg\n\nHere\u2019s what each folder contains:\n\nbin: files that interact with the virtual environment\ninclude: C headers that compile the Python packages\nlib: a copy of the Python version along with a site-packages folder where each dependency is installed\n\nFurther, there are copies of, or symlinks to, a few different Python tools as well as to the Python executables themselves. These files are used to ensure that all Python code and commands are executed within the context of the current environment, which is how the isolation from the global environment is achieved. We\u2019ll explain this in more detail in the next section.\nMore interesting are the activate scripts in the bin directory. These scripts are used to set up your shell to use the environment\u2019s Python executable and its site-packages by default.\nIn order to use this environment\u2019s packages/resources in isolation, you need to \u201cactivate\u201d it. To do this, just run the following:\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $\n\nNotice how your prompt is now prefixed with the name of your environment (env, in our case). This is the indicator that env is currently active, which means the python executable will only use this environment\u2019s packages and settings.\nTo show the package isolation in action, we can use the bcrypt module as an example. Let\u2019s say we have bcrypt installed system-wide but not in our virtual environment.\nBefore we test this, we need to go back to the \u201csystem\u201d context by executing deactivate:\n(env) $ deactivate\n$\n\nNow your shell session is back to normal, and the python command refers to the global Python install. Remember to do this whenever you\u2019re done using a specific virtual environment.\nNow, install bcrypt and use it to hash a password:\n$ pip -q install bcrypt\n$ python -c \"import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw('password'.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt()))\"\n$2b$12$vWa/VSvxxyQ9d.WGgVTdrell515Ctux36LCga8nM5QTW0.4w8TXXi\n\nHere\u2019s what happens if we try the same command when the virtual environment is activated:\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $ python -c \"import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw('password'.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt()))\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named 'bcrypt'\n\nAs you can see, the behavior of the python -c \"import bcrypt...\" command changes after the source env/bin/activate call.\nIn one instance, we have bcrypt available to us, and in the next we don\u2019t. This is the kind of separation we\u2019re looking to achieve with virtual environments, which is now easily achieved.\n    Remove adsHow Does a Virtual Environment Work?\nWhat exactly does it mean to \u201cactivate\u201d an environment? Knowing what\u2019s going on under the hood can be pretty important for a developer, especially when you need to understand execution environments, dependency resolution, and so on.\nTo explain how this works, let\u2019s first check out the locations of the different python executables. With the environment \u201cdeactivated,\u201d run the following:\n$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\n\nNow, activate it and run the command again:\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $ which python\n/Users/michaelherman/python-virtual-environments/env/bin/python\n\nAfter activating the environment, we\u2019re now getting a different path for the python executable because, in an active environment, the $PATH environment variable is slightly modified.\nNotice the difference between the first path in $PATH before and after the activation:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:\n\n$ source env/bin/activate\n(env) $ echo $PATH\n/Users/michaelherman/python-virtual-environments/env/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:\n\nIn the latter example, our virtual environment\u2019s bin directory is now at the beginning of the path. That means it\u2019s the first directory searched when running an executable on the command line. Thus, the shell uses our virtual environment\u2019s instance of Python instead of the system-wide version.\n\nNote: Other packages that bundle Python, like Anaconda, also tend to manipulate your path when you activate them. Just be aware of this in case you run into problems with your other environments. This can become a problem if you start activating multiple environments at once.\n\nThis raises the following questions:\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between these two executables anyway?\nHow is the virtual environment\u2019s Python executable able to use something other than the system\u2019s site-packages?\n\nThis can be explained by how Python starts up and where it is located on the system. There actually isn\u2019t any difference between these two Python executables. It\u2019s their directory locations that matter.\nWhen Python is starting up, it looks at the path of its binary. In a virtual environment, it is actually just a copy of, or symlink to, your system\u2019s Python binary. It then sets the location of sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix based on this location, omitting the bin portion of the path.\nThe path located in sys.prefix is then used for locating the site-packages directory by searching the relative path lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/, where X.X is the version of Python you\u2019re using.\nIn our example, the binary is located at /Users/michaelherman/python-virtual-environments/env/bin, which means sys.prefix would be /Users/michaelherman/python-virtual-environments/env, and therefore the site-packages directory used would be /Users/michaelherman/python-virtual-environments/env/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages. Finally, this path is stored in the sys.path array, which contains all of the locations where a package can reside.\nManaging Virtual Environments With virtualenvwrapper\nWhile virtual environments certainly solve some big problems with package management, they\u2019re not perfect. After creating a few environments, you\u2019ll start to see that they create some problems of their own, most of which revolve around managing the environments themselves. To help with this, the virtualenvwrapper tool was created. It\u2019s just some wrapper scripts around the main virtualenv tool.\nA few of the more useful features of virtualenvwrapper are that it:\n\nOrganizes all of your virtual environments in one location\nProvides methods to help you easily create, delete, and copy environments\nProvides a single command to switch between environments\n\nWhile some of these features may seem small or insignificant, you\u2019ll soon learn that they\u2019re important tools to add to your workflow.\nTo get started, you can download the wrapper with pip:\n$ pip install virtualenvwrapper\n\n\nNote: For Windows, you should use virtualenvwrapper-win instead.\n\nOnce it\u2019s installed, we\u2019ll need to activate its shell functions. We can do this by running source on the installed virtualenvwrapper.sh script. When you first install it with pip, the output of the installation will tell you the exact location of virtualenvwrapper.sh. Or you can simply run the following:\n$ which virtualenvwrapper.sh\n/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n\nUsing that path, add the following three lines to your shell\u2019s startup file. If you\u2019re using the Bash shell, you would place these lines in either the ~/.bashrc file or the ~/.profile file. For other shells, like zsh, csh, or fish, you would need to use the startup files specific to that shell. All that matters is that these commands are executed when you log in or open a new shell:\nexport WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs   # Optional\nexport PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/projects      # Optional\nsource /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n\n\nNote: It\u2019s not required to define the WORKON_HOME and PROJECT_HOME environment variables. virtualenvwrapper has default values for those, but you can override them by defining values.\n\nFinally, reload the startup file:\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n\nThere should now be a directory located at $WORKON_HOME that contains all of the virtualenvwrapper data/files:\n$ echo $WORKON_HOME\n/Users/michaelherman/.virtualenvs\n\nYou\u2019ll also now have the shell commands available to you to help you manage the environments. Here are just a few of the ones available:\n\nworkon\ndeactivate\nmkvirtualenv\ncdvirtualenv\nrmvirtualenv\n\nFor more info on commands, installation, and configuring virtualenvwrapper, check out the documentation.\nNow, anytime you want to start a new project, you just have to do this:\n$ mkvirtualenv my-new-project\n(my-new-project) $\n\nThis will create and activate a new environment in the directory located at $WORKON_HOME, where all virtualenvwrapper environments are stored.\nTo stop using that environment, you just need to deactivate it like before:\n(my-new-project) $ deactivate\n$\n\nIf you have many environments to choose from, you can list them all with the workon function:\n$ workon\nmy-new-project\nmy-django-project\nweb-scraper\n\nFinally, here\u2019s how to activate:\n$ workon web-scraper\n(web-scraper) $\n\nIf you would like to be able to use a single tool and switch between Python versions, virtualenv will allow you to do just that. virtualenv has a parameter -p that allows you to select which version of Python to use. Combine that with the which command, and we can easily select your preferred version of Python to use in a simple manner. For example, let\u2019s say that we want Python 3 as our preferred version:\n$ virtualenv -p $(which python3) blog_virtualenv\n\nThis will create a new Python 3 environment.\nHow does this work? The which command is used for finding a given command in your $PATH variable and returning the full path to that command. So, the full path to python3 was returned, to the -p parameter which takes a PYTHON_EXE. This could also be used for python2 as well. Just substitute python3 for python2 (or python if you system defaults to python2).\nNow you don\u2019t have to remember where you installed your environments. You can easily delete or copy them as you wish, and your project directory is less cluttered!\n    Remove adsUsing Different Versions of Python\nUnlike the old virtualenv tool, pyvenv doesn\u2019t support creating environments with arbitrary versions of Python, which means you\u2019re stuck using the default Python 3 installation for all of the environments you create. While you can upgrade an environment to the latest system version of Python (via the --upgrade option), if it changes, you still can\u2019t actually specify a particular version.\nThere are quite a few ways to install Python, but few of them are easy enough or flexible enough to frequently uninstall and re-install different versions of the binary.\nThis is where pyenv comes in to play.\nDespite the similarity in names (pyvenv vs pyenv), pyenv is different in that its focus is to help you switch between Python versions on a system-level as well as a project-level. While the purpose of pyvenv is to separate out modules, the purpose of pyenv is to separate Python versions.\nYou can start by installing pyenv with either Homebrew (on OS X) or the pyenv-installer project:\nHomebrew\n$ brew install pyenv\n\npyenv-installer\n$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash\n\n\nNote: Unfortunately, pyenv does not support Windows. A few alternatives to try are pywin and anyenv.\n\nOnce you have pyenv on your system, here are a few of the basic commands you\u2019re probably interested in:\n$ pyenv install 3.5.0   # Install new version\n$ pyenv versions        # List installed versions\n$ pyenv exec python -V  # Execute 'python -V' using pyenv version\n\nIn these few lines, we install the 3.5.0 version of Python, ask pyenv to show us all of the versions available to us, and then execute the python -V command using the pyenv-specified version.\nTo give you even more control, you can then use any of the available versions for either \u201cglobal\u201d use or \u201clocal\u201d use. Using pyenv with the local command sets the Python version for a specific project or directory by storing the version number in a local .python-version file. We can set the \u201clocal\u201d version like this:\n$ pyenv local 2.7.11\n\nThis creates the .python-version file in our current directory, as you can see here:\n$ ls -la\ntotal 16\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 michaelherman  staff  136 Feb 22 10:57 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 michaelherman  staff  306 Jan 27 20:55 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 michaelherman  staff    7 Feb 22 10:57 .python-version\n-rw-r--r--  1 michaelherman  staff   52 Jan 28 17:20 main.py\n\nThis file only contains the contents \u201c2.7.11\u201d. Now, when you execute a script using pyenv, it\u2019ll load this file and use the specified version, assuming it\u2019s valid and exists on your system.\nMoving on with our example, let\u2019s say we have a simple script called main.py in our project directory that looks like this:\nimport sys\nprint('Using version:', sys.version[:5])\n\nAll it does is print out the version number of the Python executable being used. Using pyenv and the exec command, we can run the script with any of the different versions of Python we have installed.\n$ python main.py\nUsing version: 2.7.5\n$ pyenv global 3.5.0\n$ pyenv exec python main.py\nUsing version: 3.5.0\n$ pyenv local 2.7.11\n$ pyenv exec python main.py\nUsing version: 2.7.11\n\nNotice how pyenv exec python main.py uses our \u201cglobal\u201d Python version by default, but then it uses the \u201clocal\u201d version after one is set for the current directory.\nThis can be very powerful for developers who have lots of projects with varying version requirements. Not only can you easily change the default version for all projects (via global), but you can also override it to specify special cases.\n    Remove adsConclusion\nIn this article, you learned about not only how Python dependencies are stored and resolved, but also how you can use different community tools to help get around various packaging and versioning problems.\nAs you can see, thanks to the huge Python community, there are quite a few tools at your disposal to help with these common problems.

Pipenv, Venv, and Pyenv are popular dependency management tools. Virtualenv has been deprecated in Python 3.8.\nManaging Dependencies with Pipenv\u00a0\nPipenv is a dependency manager that lets you create a separate virtual environment for each of your projects, and automatically manages the dependencies within each of them.\nYou can check to see if Pipenv is installed, with the following command:\n$ pipenv \u2013version\nYou can also check to see if Pipenv is up-to-date with the following command:\n$ pip install \u2013upgrade pipenv\nUsing Pip with Pipenv\nPip is integrated into Pipenv. Use pipenv to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file for each of your projects. As a best practice, each project should be installed in a different virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts that can arise when different projects require different versions of the same package.\n\n To create a Pipenv project using Python 3.8, cd to the directory where you would like to create the project, then enter:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $ pipenv \u2013python 3.8\nThis will automatically create a virtual environment within for you, along with a Pipfile to track dependencies for maintenance, and a Pipfile.lock file that declares all dependencies and sub-dependencies required in the project.\u00a0\n\n You can now install an individual package and its dependencies with Pipenv, by entering:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 $ pipenv install <packagename>\nNOTE: If you had not already created a Pipenv virtual environment when you installed Python 3.8, the pipenv install command will create one now and add a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock file.\nAlternatively, you can provide a requirements.txt file when running pipenv install. In this case, Pipenv will automatically import the contents of the requirements file and create a Pipfile.\n\n To ensure all the packages have been installed, you can list them.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. Cd into a Pipenv virtual environment and open a\u00a0 terminal or command window.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0b.Run the following command to retrieve a list of python packages installed in this environment:\n$ pipenv run pip list\nDependency Management with Pipfile.lock\u00a0\nWhenever a package is installed in a pipenv environment, pipfile.lock is automatically updated to reflect dependency and sub-dependency changes.\u00a0\nDepending on the circumstances, however, pipfile.lock may not update during package installation:\n\nPipfile.lock may fail to update during a package installation. For example, when cloning a repository made on another machine with a different OS, pipfile.lock may not update. Pipfile.lock incompatibilities can occur because the Pipfile.lock is system-specific.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2. Large pipfile.lock files are very slow to update, and it may be practical to postpone the update. The pipenv install \u2013skip-lock command option can be used to skip the pipfile.lock.\n\u00a0If for any reason the pipfile.lock is not updated, the\u00a0 pipenv lock command can be run to generate a new pipfile.lock file:\u00a0\u00a0\n$ pipenv install <packagename>\u00a0\n# pipfile.lock will be updated.\n$ pipenv install \u2013skip-lock <packagename>\u00a0\n# pipfile.lock will not update.\n$ pipfile lock\u00a0\n# a pipfile.lock will be generated.\nManaging Dependencies with Venv\nVenv is the successor to VirtualEnv, and functions in a similar manner with two important differences:\u00a0\n\nVenv is included in Python 3.3+ and does not have to be installed.\nVenv is a lower level tool than Pipenv, and is especially useful if Pipenv does not meet your particular virtual environment needs.\u00a0\n\nIf you are working with Python 3.8, you can create a Venv virtual environment by doing the following:\n\ncd into the directory where you would like to create your project\nOpen a terminal or command window and enter:\n\n$ python -m venv <project_directoryname>\nIf you are working with Python 3.7, you can create a Venv virtual environment by doing the following:\n\ncd into the directory where you would like to create the project\nOpen a terminal or command window and enter:\n\n$ python -m virtualenv venv <project_directoryname>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Dependencies With Pyenv\nPyenv is a Python version manager that lets you do many tasks, including:\n\nChange the global Python version\nInstall multiple Python versions\nSet directory or project specific Python versions\nCreate and manage virtual environments.\n\nNOTE:\u00a0Pyenv is a Bash extension and will not work on Windows outside of the Windows subsystem for Linux.\nPyenv Installation on Linux\nThere are two main methods for installing Pyenv:\n\nPyenv installer.\nClone Pyenv from Github, and then configure it manually.\n\nHow to Install Pyenv\nTo install Pyenv on Linux using its installer, first ensure that your system has the necessary prerequisites, including Git, Curl and Bash.\n\nOpen a terminal in Linux and enter:\n\n$ curl https://pyenv.run | bash\npyenv.run\u00a0redirects to an installation script at\u00a0https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer\n2.\u00a0Restart the shell in order for path changes to take effect:\n$ exec $SHELL\nHow to Clone Pyenv from Github\nPyenv can also be cloned from\u00a0https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git\u00a0and installed with Bash.\n\nRun the\u00a0git clone\u00a0command from a location where you want Pyenv installed to.\u00a0$HOME/.pyenv\u00a0is recommended, but it can be installed elsewhere.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv\n2. Define an environment variable called\u00a0PYENV_ROOT\u00a0to point to the path where Pyenv is cloned to, and then add\u00a0$PYENV_ROOT/bin\u00a0to your\u00a0$PATH\u00a0in order to access the Pyenv command-line utility.\n3.Use Bash to Install Pyenv on most flavors of Linux:\n$ echo \u2018export PYENV_ROOT=\u201d$HOME/.pyenv\u201d\u2018 >> ~/.bash_profile\n$ echo \u2018export PATH=\u201d$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\u201d\u2018 >> ~/.bash_profile\nFor Ubuntu desktops, use the following Bash commands:\n$ echo \u2018export PYENV_ROOT=\u201d$HOME/.pyenv\u201d\u2018 >> ~/.bashrc\n$ echo \u2018export PATH=\u201d$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\u201d\u2018 >> ~/.bashrc\n4. Add\u00a0pyenv init\u00a0to your shell in order to enable it. Put\u00a0eval \u201c$(pyenv init -)\u201d\u00a0 toward the end of the shell configuration file, like so:\n$ echo -e \u2018if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\\n\u00a0 eval \u201c$(pyenv init -)\u201d\\nfi\u2019 >> ~/.bash_profile\nNote:\u00a0for Ubuntu and Fedora Linux modify the\u00a0~/.bashrc\u00a0file instead of\u00a0~/.bash_profile.\nCaution: some systems have the\u00a0BASH_ENV\u00a0variable configured to point to\u00a0.bashrc. To avoid unpredictable behavior on these systems, you should put\u00a0\u00a0eval \u201c$(pyenv init -)\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0into .bash_profile, and not into .bashrc.\n5. Restart the shell in order for path changes to take effect:\n$ exec \u201c$SHELL\u201d\nPyenv Usage\nPyenv commands will let you install and manage multiple Python versions in the same system.\nTo list all Python versions available for installation, enter:\n$ pyenv install \u2013list\nAvailable versions:\n2.1.3\n2.2.3\n2.3.7\n\u2026\n\u2026\n3.8.1\nTo install python 3.8.1, enter:\n$ pyenv install 3.8.1\n\u00a0\nTo determine which version of Python you are currently using, enter:\n$\u00a0 pyenv version\n\u00a0\nTo view all Python versions currently installed on the system and available for use, enter:\n$ pyenv versions\n\u00a0\nTo set the global version of Python to be used in all shells, enter:\u00a0\n$ python global\u00a0<version#>\n\u00a0\nTo set the local version of Python to be used for a specific project, overriding the global version, enter:\n$ python local\u00a0<version#>\n\u00a0\nTo set the version of Python to be used in a specific instance of a shell, enter:\u00a0\n$ pyenv shell\u00a0<version#>\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0pyenv shell\u00a0command resets the\u00a0PYENV_VERSION\u00a0environment variable in the shell.

Reasons could range from using a newer version of a module to using a specific version in case there is a regression.\nThese requirements and use cases can be a pain to manage when different applications require different versions of the same library. Thankfully, Python provides a robust solution to isolate development environments using virtual environments.\nWhat is a Python Virtual Environment?\nA Python virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree that contains a specific Python installation along with all of its standard libraries. Applications requiring a particular version of library can be isolated in these virtual environments without polluting the system or other Python implementations. Each virtual environment is a separate sandbox, so you can create as many as virtual environments you want.\nCreating and Managing Virtual Environments\nTo create virtual environments in Ubuntu, first install the required dependency package by running command:\n$ sudo apt install python3-venv\nYou can now create virtual environments by running command:\n$ python3 -m venv myenv\nRunning the command above will create a virtual environment called \u201cmyenv\u201d in your home directory. If you want to use any other version of Python, you can replace \u201cpython3\u201d above with full path to the location of your alternative Python binary.\nTo activate the custom environment created above, run command:\n$ source myenv/bin/activate\nOnce the virtual environment is activated, shell prompt will change to reflect the current virtual environment you are using. If you run \u201csys.path\u201d command inside Python interpreter, you can see that virtual environment is working properly. Python will now look for packages inside the custom environment you have just created.\n\nIf your shell prompt doesn\u2019t show the name of virtual environment as prefix, any Python file you run will use system Python instead. So it is necessary to source virtual environment before running a file in your custom environment.\nYou can deactivate a virtual environment by running command:\n$ deactivate\nEvery Python virtual environment includes a \u201cpyvenv.cfg\u201d file having a \u201cinclude-system-site-packages\u201d key which is set to \u201cfalse\u201d by default. This key tells virtual environment whether to use system site-packages or not. If set to \u201ctrue\u201d, Python in virtual environment will look into system packages in case a package is not found in the virtual environment. It will also make all system installed packages importable inside the virtual environment.\n\nTo delete a virtual environment, you just have to delete the virtual environment directory and it will be gone.\nIt is possible to create and store virtualenv on external USB drives. You will need to have USB drive formatted in NTFS or EXT file system. FAT32 file system doesn\u2019t support symlinks which is a requirements for virtual environments to work.\nUsing Pip Package Manager to Install Packages Inside Virtual Environment\nInside a virtual environment, you can use pip package manager to install, upgrade and uninstall packages. It is possible to downgrade or upgrade a package by specifying a particular version number.\nYou can install a package using pip by running command (replace pygame with your desired package name):\n$ pip install pygame\n\nA searchable repository of pip packages can be found here.\nTo uninstall a package, use command:\n$ pip uninstall pygame\n\nTo see all versions of a package, run command:\n$ pip install pygame==\n\nTo downgrade or upgrade to a specific version, use command (replace \u201c1.9.5\u201d with your desired version number):\n$ pip install pygame==1.9.5\n\nTo upgrade a package to newest version, run command:\n$ pip install --upgrade pygame\n\nTo see all packages installed in virtual environment, run command:\n$ pip list\n\nTo save a list of installed packages inside virtualenv, run command:\n$ pip freeze > requirements.txt\nYou can use above \u201crequirements.txt\u201d file to install packages in bulk. One use case is to duplicate an existing environment by installing all packages from scratch. To install pip packages in bulk, run command:\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\nUsing Python Virtual Environments with Non-Python Applications\nApplications written in other programming languages can be sandboxed in Python virtual environments as long as pip or any other Python package manager provides binaries and packages for these alternate programming languages/frameworks.\nHere is a small example that explains installing Node.js in Python virtual environment. Run the following commands one by one:\n$ python3 -m venv my_node_env\n$ source my_node_env/bin/activate\n$ pip install wheel\n$ pip install nodeenv\n$ nodeenv -p\n$ nodeenv --version\n$ node --version\n\nOnce done, you will have a completely isolated Node.js environment. You can create as many as virtual environments as you want for different Node.js applications. Packages installed via npm package manager will be confined to activated virtual environment only.\nConclusion\nCreating a Python virtual environment is an excellent way to containerize development environments. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary and its own independent set of packages. Developing multiple Python applications on the same system can quickly pollute your home and root directory and virtual environments make it so easy to maintain them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n \n\nNitesh Kumar\n\nI am a freelancer software developer and content writer who loves Linux, open source software and the free software community.\n\n\n\n\n\nView all posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED LINUX HINT POSTS\nHow to Create a Simple Application in Python and GTK3Python String replace() FunctionThe split() Function in PythonHow to Create a Hello World Application in Python Using TkinterPython Pickle TutorialPython for loopPython If Else statement\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowered by LiquidWeb Web Hosting\nLinux Hint LLC, editor@linuxhint.com\r\n1210 Kelly Park Cir, Morgan Hill, CA 95037\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

Scope Planning\t\n\nYou always want to know exactly what work has to be done before you start it. You\u00a0have\u00a0a collection of team members, and you need to know exactly what they\u2019re going to do to meet the project\u2019s objectives. The scope planning process is the very first thing you do to manage your scope. Project scope planning is concerned with the definition of all the work needed to successfully meet the project objectives. The whole idea here is that when you start the project, you need to have a clear picture of all the work that needs to happen on your project, and as the project progresses, you need to keep that scope up to date and written down in the project\u2019s scope management plan.\nDefining the Scope\nYou already have\u00a0a head start on refining the project\u2019s objectives in quantifiable terms, but now you need to plan further and write down all the intermediate and final deliverables that you and your team will\u00a0produce over the course of the project. Deliverables include everything that you and your team produce for the project\u00a0(i.e.,\u00a0anything that your project will deliver). The deliverables for your project include all of the products or services that you and your team are performing for the client, customer, or sponsor. They include every intermediate document, plan, schedule, budget, blueprint, and anything else that will be made along the way, including all of the project management documents you put together. Project deliverables are tangible outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be produced to consider either the project or the project phase completed. Intermediate deliverables, like the objectives, must be specific and verifiable.\nAll deliverables must be described in a sufficient level of detail so that they can be differentiated from related deliverables. For example:\n\nA twin engine plane versus a single engine plane\nA red marker versus a green marker\nA daily report versus a weekly report\nA departmental solution versus an enterprise solution\n\nOne of the project manager\u2019s primary functions is to accurately document the deliverables of the project and then manage the project so that they are produced according to the agreed-on criteria. Deliverables are the output of each development phase, described in a quantifiable way.\nProject Requirements\nAfter all the deliverables are identified, the project manager needs to document all the requirements of the project. Requirements describe the characteristics of the final deliverable, whether it is\u00a0a product or a service. They describe the required functionality that the final deliverable must have or specific conditions the final deliverable must meet in order to satisfy the objectives of the project. A requirement is an objective that must be met. The project\u2019s requirements, defined in the scope plan, describe what a project is supposed to accomplish and how the project is supposed to be created and implemented. Requirements answer the following questions regarding the as-is and to-be states of the business: who, what, where, when, how much, and how does a business process work?\nRequirements may include attributes like dimensions, ease of use, colour, specific ingredients, and so on. If we go back to the example of the company producing holiday eggnog, one of the major deliverables is the cartons that hold the eggnog. The requirements for that deliverable may include carton design, photographs that will appear on the carton, colour choices, etc.\nRequirements specify what the\u00a0final project deliverable should look like and what it should do. Requirements must be measurable, testable, related to identified business needs or opportunities, and defined to a level of detail sufficient for system design. They can be divided into six basic categories: functional, non-functional, technical, business,\u00a0user, and regulatory requirements.\nFunctional Requirements\nFunctional requirements describe the characteristics of the final deliverable in ordinary non-technical language. They should be understandable to the customers, and the customers should play a direct role in their development. Functional requirements are what you want the deliverable to do.\nVehicle Example\nIf you were buying vehicles for a business, your functional requirement might be: \u201cThe vehicles should be able to take up to a one ton load from a warehouse to a shop.\u201d\nComputer System Example\nFor a computer system you may define what the system is to do: \u201cThe system should store all details of a customer\u2019s order.\u201d\nThe important point to note is that what is wanted is specified and not\u00a0how it will be delivered.\nNon-Functional Requirements\nNon-functional requirements specify criteria that can be used to judge the final product or service that your project delivers. They are restrictions or constraints to be placed on the deliverable and how to build it. Their purpose is to restrict the number of solutions that will meet a set of requirements. Using the vehicle example, the functional requirement is for\u00a0a vehicle to take a load from a warehouse to a shop. Without any constraints,\u00a0the solutions being offered might result in anything from a small to a large truck. Non-functional requirements can be split into two types: performance and development.\nTo restrict the types of solutions, you might include these performance constraints:\n\nThe purchased trucks should be American-made trucks due to government incentives.\nThe load area must be covered.\nThe load area must have a height of at least 10 feet.\n\nSimilarly, for the computer system example, you might specify values for the generic types of performance constraints:\n\nThe response time for information is displayed on the screen for the user.\nThe number of hours a system should be available.\nThe number of records a system should be able to hold.\nThe capacity for growth of the system should be built in.\nThe length of time a record should be held for auditing purposes.\n\nFor the customer records example, the constraints might be:\n\nThe system should be available from 9 a.m.\u00a0to 5 p.m.Monday to Friday.\nThe system should be able to hold 100,000 customer records initially.\nThe system should be able to add 10,000 records a year for 10 years.\nA record should be fully available on the system for at least seven\u00a0years.\n\nOne important point with these examples is that they restrict the number of solution options that are offered to you by the developer. In addition to the performance constraints, you may include some development constraints.\nThere are three general types of non-functional development constraints:\n\nTime: When a deliverable should be delivered\nResource: How much money is available to develop the deliverable\nQuality: Any standards that are used to develop the deliverable, development methods, etc.\n\nTechnical Requirements\nTechnical requirements emerge from the functional requirements\u00a0to\u00a0answer the questions: how will the problem be solved this time and will it be solved technologically and/or procedurally? They specify\u00a0how the system needs to be designed and implemented to provide required functionality and fulfill required operational characteristics.\nFor example, in a software project, the functional requirements may stipulate that a database system will be developed to allow access to financial data through a remote terminal. The corresponding technical requirements would spell out the required data elements, the language in which the database management system will be written (due to existing knowledge in-house), the hardware on which the system will run (due to existing infrastructure), telecommunication protocols that should be used, and so forth.\nBusiness Requirements\nBusiness requirements are the needs of the sponsoring organization, always from a management perspective. Business requirements are statements of the business rationale for the project. They are usually expressed in broad outcomes, satisfying the business needs, rather than specific functions the system must\u00a0perform. These requirements grow out of the vision for the product that, in turn, is driven by mission (or business) goals and objectives.\nUser Requirements\nUser requirements describe what the users need to do with the system or product. The focus is on the user experience with the system under all scenarios. These requirements are the input for the next development phases: user-interface design and system test cases design.\nRegulatory requirements\nRegulatory requirements can be internal or external and are usually non-negotiable. They are the restrictions, licenses, and laws applicable to a product or business that are imposed by the government.\nAn Example of Requirements\nAutomated teller machines (ATMs) can be used to illustrate a wide range of requirements (Figure 9.1). What are some of the physical features of these machines, and what kinds of functions do they perform for the bank\u2019s customers? Why did banks put these systems in place? What are the high-level business requirements?\nFigure 9.1 Automated Teller Machine.\nThe following represents one possible example of each type of requirement as they would be applied to a bank\u2019s external ATM.\n\nATM functional requirement: The system will\u00a0enable the user to select whether or not to produce a hard-copy transaction receipt before completing a transaction.\nATM non-functional requirement: All displays will\u00a0be in white, 14-point Arial text on black back\u00adground.\nATM technical requirement: The ATM system will connect seamlessly to the existing customer\u2019s database.\nATM user requirement: The system will\u00a0complete a standard withdrawal from a personal account, from login to cash, in less than two minutes.\nATM business requirement: By providing superior service to our retail customers, Monumental Bank\u2019s ATM network will allow us to increase associated service fee revenue by 10% annually on an ongoing basis.\nATM regulatory requirement: All ATMs will\u00a0connect to standard utility power sources within their civic jurisdiction, and be supplied with an uninterrupted power source approved by the company.\n\nThe effective specification of requirements is one of the most challenging undertakings project managers face. Inadequately specified requirements will guarantee poor project results.\nDocumenting requirements is much more than just the process of writing down the requirements as the user sees them; it should cover not only what decisions have been made, but why they have been made, as well. Understanding the reasoning that was used to arrive at a decision is critical in avoiding repetition. For example, the fact that a particular feature has been excluded, because it is simply not feasible, needs to be recorded. If it is not, then the project risks wasted work and repetition, when a stakeholder requests the feature be reinstated during development or testing.\nOnce the requirements are documented, have the stakeholders sign off on their requirements as a confirmation of what they desire.\nWhile the project manager is responsible for making certain the requirements are documented, it does not mean that the project manager performs this task. The project manager enlists the help of all the stakehold\u00aders\u00a0(business analysts, requirement analysts, business process owners, customers and other team members) to conduct the discussions, brain-storming, and interviews, and to document and sign\u00a0off\u00a0the requirements. The project manager is responsible only for enabling the process and facilitating it. If the project manager feels that the quality of the document is questionable, his or her duty is to stop the development process.\nThe project manager reviews the requirements, incorporates them into the project documentation library, and uses them as an input for the project plan.\nSoftware Requirements Fundamentals\nThis section refers to requirements of \u201csoftware\u201d because it is concerned with problems to be addressed by software. A software requirement is a property that\u00a0must be exhibited by software developed or adapted to solve a particular problem. The problem may be to automate part of a task of someone who will use the software, to support the business processes of the organization that has commissioned the software, to correct shortcomings of existing software, to control a device, etc. The functioning of users, business processes, and devices is typically complex. Therefore, the requirements on particular software are typically a complex combination of requirements from different people at different levels of an organization and from the environment in which the software will operate.\nAn essential property of all software requirements is that they be verifiable. It may be difficult or costly to verify certain software requirements. For example, verification of the throughput requirement on a\u00a0call centre may necessitate the development of simulation software. Both the software requirements and software quality personnel must ensure that the requirements can be verified within the available resource constraints.\nRequirements have other attributes in addition to the behavioural properties that they express. Common examples include a priority rating to enable trade-offs in the face of finite resources and a status value to enable project progress to be monitored. Typically, software requirements are uniquely identified so that they can be monitored over the entire software life cycle.\nMeasuring Requirements\nAs a practical matter, it is typically useful to have some concept of the volume of the requirements for a particular software product. This number is useful in evaluating the size of a change in requirements, in estimating the cost of a development or maintenance task, or simply in using it as the denominator in other measurements (see Table 9.1).\n\nTable 9.1: Measuring Requirements\n\n\nProperty\nMeasure\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nProcessed transactions/second\nUser/Event response time\nScreen refresh time\n\n\n\n\nSize\n\n\nK Bytes\nNumber of RAM chips\n\n\n\n\nEase of use\n\n\nTraining time\nNumber of help frames\n\n\n\n\nReliability\n\n\nMean time to failure\nProbability of unavailability\nRate of failure occurence\nAvailability\n\n\n\n\nRobustness\n\n\nTime to restart after failure\nPercentage of events causing failure\nProbability of data corruption on failure\n\n\n\n\nPortability\n\n\nPercentage of target dependent statements\nNumber of target systems\n\n\n\n\n\nScope Inputs\nThe project manager gathers initial project facts from the project charter. In addition, background information on the stakeholder\u2019s workplace, existing business model and rules, etc. assist in creating the vision of the final product/service, and consequently, the project scope (see Figure 9.2).\n\nFigure 9.2: Scope input-output. [Image description]\nTechniques\nCertainly being a seasoned project manager broadens the repertoire of one\u2019s scope planning techniques. An experienced\u00a0project manager\u00a0can draw on past experiences with like projects to determine the work that is realistically doable, given time and cost constraints, for a current project. Communication and negotiation skills are a \u201cmust-have\u201d as well. Project managers need to educate stakeholders about the project impacts of some requirements. Adding complexity to a project may require more staff, time, and/or money. It may also have an impact on project quality. Some aspects of the project may be unfeasible \u2013 stakeholders need to know this so they can adjust their vision or prepare for future challenges.\nGathering requirements is part of scope definition, and it can be done using one or more of following techniques:\n\nInterviews\nFocus groups\nFacilitated groups such as JAD (joint application development)\nGroup creativity techniques: brainstorming, nominal groups, delphi, mind map, affinity diagnostics\nPrototyping\nObservation\nQuestions and surveys\nGroup decision-making techniques: unanimity, majority, plurality, dictatorship\n\nRequirements Traceability Matrix\nThe requirements traceability matrix is a table that links requirements to their origin and traces them throughout the project life cycle. The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope. This process includes, but is not limited to, tracking:\n\nRequirements to business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives\nRequirements to project objectives\nRequirements to project scope/work breakdown structure deliverables\nRequirements to product design\nRequirements to product development\nRequirements to test strategy and test scenarios\nHigh-level requirements to more detailed requirements\n\nAttributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix. These attributes help to define key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceability matrix may include a unique identifier, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner, source, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved), and date completed. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction may include stability, complexity, and acceptance criteria.\nMatrix Fields\nThese are suggestions only and will vary based on organizational and project requirements.\n\nA unique identification number containing the general category of the requirement (e.g., SYSADM) and a number assigned in ascending order (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)\nRequirement statement\nRequirement source (conference, configuration control board, task assignment, etc.)\nSoftware requirements specification/functional requirements document paragraph number containing the requirement\nDesign specification paragraph number containing the requirement\nProgram module containing the requirement\nTest specification containing the requirement test\nTest case number(s) where requirement is to be tested (optional)\nVerification of successful testing of requirements\nModification field\u00a0(If a requirement was changed, eliminated, or replaced, indicate disposition and authority for modification.)\nRemarks\n\nWork Breakdown Structure\nNow that we have the deliverables and requirements well defined, the process of breaking down the work of the project via a work breakdown structure\u00a0(WBS) begins. The WBS defines the scope of the project and breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled, estimated, and easily monitored and controlled. The idea behind the WBS\u00a0is simple: you subdivide a complicated task into smaller tasks, until you reach a level that cannot be further subdivided. Anyone familiar with the arrangements of folders and files in a computer memory or who has researched their ancestral family tree should be familiar with this idea. You stop breaking down the work when you reach a low enough level to perform an estimate of the desired accuracy. At that point, it is usually easier to estimate how long the small task will take and how much it will cost to perform than it would have been to estimate these factors at the higher levels. Each descending level of the WBS represents an increased level of detailed definition of the project work.\nWBS describes the products or services to be delivered by the project and how they are decomposed and related. It is a deliverable-oriented decomposition of a project into smaller components. It defines and groups a project\u2019s discrete work elements in a way that helps organize and define the total work scope of the project.\nA WBS also provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimating and control, along with providing guidance for schedule development and control.\nOverview\nWBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into phases, deliverables, and work packages. It is a tree structure, which shows a subdivision of effort required to achieve an objective\u00a0(e.g., a program, project, and contract). In a project or contract, the WBS is developed by starting with the end objective and successively subdividing it into manageable components in terms of size, duration, and responsibility (e.g., systems, subsystems, components, tasks, subtasks, and work packages), which include all steps necessary to achieve the objective.\nThe WBS creation involves:\n\nListing all the project outputs (deliverables and other direct results)\nIdentifying\u00a0all the activities required to deliver the outputs\nSubdividing\u00a0these activities into subactivities and tasks\nIdentifying\u00a0the deliverable and milestone(s) of each task\nIdentifying\u00a0the time usage of all the resources (personnel and material) required to complete each task\n\nThe purpose of developing a WBS is to:\n\nAllow easier management of each component\nAllow accurate estimation of time, cost, and resource requirements\nAllow easier assignment of human resources\nAllow easier assignment of responsibility for activities\n\nExample of a WBS\nIf I want to clean a room, I might begin by picking up clothes, toys, and other things that have been dropped on the floor. I could use a vacuum cleaner to get dirt out of the carpet. I might take down the curtains and take them to the cleaners, and then dust the furniture. All of these tasks are subtasks performed to clean the room. As for vacuuming the room, I might have to get the vacuum cleaner out of the closet, connect the hose, empty the bag, and put the machine back in the closet. These are smaller tasks to be performed in accomplishing the subtask called vacuuming. Figure 9.3\u00a0shows how this might be portrayed in WBS format.\n\nFigure 9.3: A WBS for cleaning a room. [Image description]\nIt is very important to note that we do not worry about the sequence in which the work is performed or any dependencies between the\u00a0tasks\u00a0when we do a WBS. That will be worked out when we develop the schedule. For example, under 3.0 Vacuum, it would be obvious that 3.3 Vacuum carpet would be performed after 3.4 Connect hose and plug! However, you will probably find yourself thinking sequentially, as it seems to be human nature to do so. The main idea of creating a WBS is to capture all of the tasks, irrespective of their order. So if you find yourself and other members of your team thinking sequentially, don\u2019t be too concerned, but don\u2019t get hung up on trying to diagram the sequence or you will slow down the process of task identification. A WBS can be structured any way it makes sense to you and your project. In practice, the chart structure is used quite often but it can be composed in outline form as well (Figure 9.4).\n\nFigure 9.4: Clean Room in an outline view.\nYou\u2019ll notice that each element at each level of the WBS in both figures is assigned a unique identifier. This unique identifier is typically a number, and it\u2019s used to sum and track costs, schedules, and resources associated with WBS elements. These numbers are usually associated with the corporation\u2019s chart of accounts, which is used to track costs by category. Collectively, these numeric identifiers are known as the code of accounts.\nThere are also many ways you can organize the WBS. For example, it can be organized by either deliverable or phase. The major deliverables of the project are used as the first level in the WBS. For example, if you are doing a multimedia project the deliverables might include producing a book, CD, and a DVD (Figure 9.5).\nFigure 9.5: A WBS for a multimedia project\nMany projects are structured or organized by project phases (Figure 9.6). Each phase would represent the first level of the WBS and their deliverables would be the next level and so on.\nFigure 9.6: WBS Project Phases\nThe project manager is free to determine the number of levels in the WBS based on the complexity of the project. You need to include enough levels to accurately estimate project time and costs but not so many levels that are difficult to distinguish between components. Regardless of the number of levels in a WBS, the lowest level is called a work package.\nWork packages are the components that can be easily assigned to one person or a team of people, with clear accountability and responsibility for completing the assignment. The work-package level is where time estimates, cost estimates, and resource estimates are determined.\n100 Percent Rule\nThe 100 percent rule is the most important criterion in developing and evaluating the WBS. The rule states that each decomposed level (child) must represent 100 percent of the work applicable to the next higher (parent) element. In other words, if each level of the WBS follows the 100 percent rule down to the activities, then we are confident that 100 percent of the activities will have been identified when we develop the project schedule.\u00a0When we create the budget for our project, 100 percent of the costs or resources required will be identified.\nScope Statement\nScope statements may take many forms depending on the type of project being implemented and the nature of the organization. The scope statement details the project deliverables and describes the major objectives. The objectives should include measurable success criteria for the project.\nA scope statement\u00a0 captures, in very broad terms, the product of the project: for example, \u201cdevelopment of a software-based system to capture and track orders for software.\u201d A scope statement should also include the list of users using the product, as well as the features in the resulting product.\nAs a baseline scope statements should contain:\n\nThe project name\nThe project charter\nThe project owner, sponsors, and stakeholders\nThe problem statement\nThe project goals and objectives\nThe project requirements\nThe project deliverables\nThe project non-goals (what is out of scope)\nMilestones\nCost estimates\n\nIn more project-oriented organizations, the scope statement may also contain these and other sections:\n\nProject scope management plan\nApproved change requests\nProject assumptions and risks\nProject acceptance criteria\n\nImage Descriptions\nFigure 9.2 image description: A project manager develops a Scope Management Plan by taking the project charter, organizational memory, and the project plan and applying the following techniques and tools:\n\nCalls on past project experience\nUses scope management templates (SOS, WBS, Scope Management Plan)\nUses Communication skills (for negotiating with and educating clients)\n\n[Return to Figure 9.2]\nFigure 9.3 image description:\n0.0 Clean Room\n\n1.0 Mop floor.\n\n1.1 Get mop and bucket out.\n1.2 Mix cleaner with water in bucket.\n1.3 Rinse out bucket and mop.\n\n\n2.0 Dust\n\n2.1 Coffee table\n2.2 Blinds\n\n\n3.0 Vacuum\n\n3.1 Get vacuum out of closet\n3.2 Vacuum carpet\n3.3 Empty bag\n3.4 Connect hose and plug\n\n\n4.0 Pick up floor\n\n4.1 Toys\n\n4.1.1 Put toys in box\n\n\n4.2 Clothes\n\n4.2.1 Hang up in closet\n\n\n\n\n5.0 Clean curtains\n\n5.1 Remove curtains\n5.2 Take to cleaners\n5.3 Hang curtains\n\n\n\n[Return to Figure 9.3]\n\u00a0Text Attributions\nThis chapter of Project Management is a derivative of the following texts:\n\nProject Management by Merrie Barron and Andrew Barron. \u00a9 CC BY (Attribution).\nProject Management/PMBOK/Scope Management\u00a0and\u00a0Development Cooperation Handbook/Designing and Executing Projects/Detailed Planning or design stage\u00a0by Wikibooks. \u00a9 CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike).\nRequirements Traceability Matrix\u00a0by DHWiki.\u00a0\u00a9 CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives)\nWork Breakdown Structure by Wikipedia. \u00a9 CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike).\n100 Percent Rule by Pabipedia. \u00a9 CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike).\n\nMedia AttributionsATM  \u00a9  megawatts86    is licensed under a  CC BY-SA (Attribution ShareAlike) licenseScope Management IO  \u00a9  Flaming Sevens  adapted by  Josie Gray  is licensed under a  Public Domain licenseWBS Cleaning Room  \u00a9  Barron & Barron Project Management for Scientists and Engineers    is licensed under a  CC BY (Attribution) licenseWBS Outline \u2013 Clean Room  \u00a9  Barron & Barron Project Management for Scientists and Engineers    is licensed under a  CC BY (Attribution) licenseMultimedia Project WBS  \u00a9  Barron & Barron Project Management for Scientists and Engineers    is licensed under a  CC BY (Attribution) licenseWBS Project Phases  \u00a9  Barron & Barron Project Management for Scientists and Engineers    is licensed under a  CC BY (Attribution) license\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrevious: 8.

Project Completion\t\n\nEvery project needs to end and that\u2019s what project completion is all about in the last phase of the project life cycle. The whole point of the project is to deliver what you promised. By delivering everything you said you would, you make sure that all stakeholders are satisfied and all acceptance criteria have been met. Once that happens, your project can end.\nProject completion is often the most neglected phase of the project life cycle. Once the project is over, it\u2019s easy to pack things up, throw some files in a drawer, and start moving right into the initiation phase of the next project. Hold on. You\u2019re not done yet.\nThe key activities in project completion are\u00a0gathering project records;\u00a0disseminating information to formalize acceptance of the product, service, or project; and performing project closure. As the project manager, you will need to review project documents to make certain they are up-to-date. For example, perhaps some scope change requests were implemented that changed some of the characteristics of the final product. The project information you are collecting during this phase should reflect the characteristics and specifications of the final product. Don\u2019t forget to update your resource assignments as well. Some team members will have come and gone over the course of the project. You need to double-check that all the resources and their roles and responsibilities are noted.\nOnce the project outcomes are documented, you\u2019ll request formal acceptance from the stakeholders or customer. They\u2019re interested in knowing if the product or service of the project meets the objectives the project set out to accomplish. If your documentation is up-to-date, you\u2019ll have the project results at hand to share with them.\nContract Closure\nContracts come to a close just as projects come to a close. Contract closure is concerned with completing and settling the terms of the contracts let for the project. It supports the project completion process because the contract closure process determines if the work described in the contracts was completed accurately and satisfactorily. Keep in mind that not all projects are performed under contract so not all projects require the contract closure process. Obviously, this process applies only to those phases, deliverables, or portions of the project that were performed under contract.\nContract closure updates the project records, detailing the final results of the work on the project. Con\u00adtracts may have specific terms or conditions for completion. You should be aware of these terms or conditions so that project completion isn\u2019t held up because you missed an important detail. If you are administering the contract yourself, be sure to ask your procurement department if there are any special conditions that you should be aware of so that your project team doesn\u2019t inadvertently delay contract project closure.\nOne of the purposes of the contract closure process is to provide formal notice to the seller,\u00a0usually in written form, that the deliverables are acceptable and satisfactory or have been rejected. If the product or service does not meet the expectations, the vendor will need to correct the problems before you issue a formal acceptance notice. Before the contract is closed, any minor items that need to be repaired or completed are placed on a punch list, which is a list of all the items found by the client or team\u00a0or\u00a0manager that still remain to be done. Hopefully, quality audits have been performed during the course of the project, and the vendor was given the opportunity to make corrections earlier in the process than the closing phase. It\u2019s not a good idea to wait until the very end of the project and then spring all the problems and issues on the vendor at once. It\u2019s much more efficient to discuss problems with your vendor as the project progresses because it provides the opportunity for correction when the problems occur.\nThe project team will then work on all of the items on the punch list, building a small schedule to complete the remaining work. If the number of items on the punch list is too large or the amount of work is significant, the project team continues to work on the project. Once the punch list becomes smaller, the project manager begins closing down the project, maintaining only enough staff and equipment to support the team that is working on the punch list.\nIf the product or service does meet the project\u2019s expectations and is acceptable, formal written notice to the seller is required, indicating that the contract is complete. This is the formal acceptance and closure of the contract. It\u2019s your responsibility as the project manager to document the formal acceptance of the contract. Many times the provisions for formalizing acceptance and closing the contract are spelled out in the contract itself.\nIf you have a procurement department handling the contract administration, they will expect you to inform them when the contract is complete and will in turn follow the formal procedures to let the seller know the contract is complete. However, you will still note the contract completion in your copy of the project records.\nReleasing the Project Team\nReleasing project team members is not an official process. However, it should be noted that at the conclusion of the project, you will release your project team members, and they will go back to their functional managers or get assigned to a new project. You will want to keep their managers, or other project managers, informed as you get closer to project completion, so that they have time to adequately plan for the return of their employees. Let them know a few months ahead of time what the schedule looks like and how soon they can plan on using their employees on new projects. This gives the other managers the ability to start planning activities and scheduling activity dates.\nFinal Payments\nThe final payment is usually more than a simple percentage of the work that remains to be completed. Completing the project might involve fixing the most difficult problems that are disproportionately expensive to solve, so the final payment should be large enough to motivate the vendor to give the project a high priority so that the project can be completed on time.\nIf the supplier has met all the contractual obligations, including fixing problems and making repairs as noted on a punch list, the project team signs off on the contract and submits it to the accounting department for final payment. The supplier is notified that the last payment is final and completes the contractual agreement with\u00a0the project.\nPost-Project Evaluations\nBefore the team is dissolved and begins to focus on the next project, a review is conducted to capture the lessons that can be learned from this project, often called a lessons-learned meeting or document. The team explores what went well and captures the processes to understand why they went well. The team asks if the process is transferable to other projects. The team also explores what did not go well and what people learned from the experience. The process is not to find blame, but to learn.\nQuality management is a process of continual improvement that includes learning from past projects and making changes to improve the next project. This process is documented as evidence that quality management practices are in use. Some organizations have formal processes for changing work processes and integrating the lessons learned from the project so other projects can benefit. Some organizations are less formal in the approach and expect individuals to learn from the experience and take the experience to their next project and share what they learned with others in an informal way. Whatever type of approach is used, the following elements should be evaluated and the results summarized in reports for external and internal use.\nTrust and Alignment Effectiveness\nThe project leadership reviews the effect of trust\u2014or lack of trust\u2014on the project and the effectiveness of alignment meetings at building trust. The team determines which problems might have been foreseen and mitigated and which ones could not have been reasonably predicted. What were the cues that were missed by the team that indicated a problem was emerging? What could the team have done to better predict and prevent trust issues?\nSchedule and Budget Management\nThe original schedule of activities and the network diagram are compared to the actual schedule of events. Events that caused changes to the schedule are reviewed to see how the use of contingency reserves and float mitigated the disruption caused by those events. The original estimates of contingency time are reviewed to determine if they were adequate and if the estimates of duration and float were accurate. These activities are necessary for the project team to develop expertise in estimating schedule elements in future projects\u2014they are not used to place blame.\nA review of budget estimates for the cost of work scheduled is compared to the actual costs. If the estimates are frequently different from the actual costs, the choice of estimating method is reviewed.\nRisk Mitigation\nAfter the project is finished, the estimates of risk can be reviewed and compared to the events that actually took place. Did events occur that were unforeseen? What cues existed that may have allowed the team to predict these events? Was the project contingency sufficient to cover unforeseen risks? Even if nothing went wrong on this project, it is not proof that risk mitigation was a waste of money, but it is useful to compare the cost of avoiding risk versus the cost of unexpected events to understand how much it cost to avoid risk.\nProcurement Contracts\nThe performance of suppliers and vendors is reviewed to determine if they should still be included in the list of qualified suppliers or vendors. The choice of contract for each is reviewed to determine if the decision to share risk was justified and if the choice of incentives worked.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nRelationships with the client are reviewed and decisions about including the client in project decisions and alignment meetings are discussed. The client is given the opportunity to express satisfaction and identify areas in which project communication and other factors could be improved. Often a senior manager from the organization interviews the client to develop feedback on the project team performance.\nA general report that provides an overview of the project is created to provide stakeholders with a summary of the project. The report includes the original goals and objectives and statements that show how the project met those goals and objectives. Performance on the schedule and budget are summarized and an assessment of client satisfaction is provided. A version of this report can be provided to the client as a stakeholder and as another means for deriving feedback.\nSenior Management\nThe report to senior management contains all the information provided to the stakeholders in a short executive summary. The report identifies practices and processes that could be improved or lessons that were learned that could be useful on future projects.\nArchiving of Document\nThe documents associated with the project must be stored in a safe location where they can be retrieved for future reference. Signed contracts or other documents that might be used in tax reviews or lawsuits must be stored. Organizations will have legal document storage and retrieval policies that apply to project documents and must be followed. Some project documents can be stored electronically.\nCare should be taken to store documents in a form that can be recovered easily. If the documents are stored electronically, standard naming conventions should be used so documents can be sorted and grouped by name. If documents are stored in paper form, the expiration date of the documents should be determined so they can be destroyed at some point in the future. The following are documents that are typically archived:\n\nCharter documents\nScope statement\nOriginal budget\nChange documents\nDPCI ratings\nManager\u2019s summary\u2014lessons learned\nFinal DPCI rating\n\nText Attributions\nThis chapter of Project Management is a derivative of the following texts:\n\nProject Management by Merrie Barron and Andrew Barron. \u00a9 CC BY (Attribution)\nProject Management for Instructional Designers by Wiley, et al. \u00a9 CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrevious: Adrienne Watt\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNext: 19.

The Owners' Perspective\n1.1 Introduction\nLike the five blind men encountering different parts of an elephant, each of \r\nthe numerous participants in the process of planning, designing, financing, \r\nconstructing and operating physical facilities has a different perspective on \r\nproject management for construction. Specialized knowledge can be very \r\nbeneficial, particularly in large and complicated projects, since experts in \r\nvarious specialties can provide valuable services. However, it is advantageous \r\nto understand how the different parts of the process fit together. Waste, \r\nexcessive cost and delays can result from poor coordination and communication \r\namong specialists. It is particularly in the interest of owners to insure that \r\nsuch problems do not occur. And it behooves all participants in the process to \r\nheed the interests of owners because, in the end, it is the owners who provide \r\nthe resources and call the shots. \nBy adopting the viewpoint of the owners, we can focus our attention on the \r\ncomplete process of project management for constructed facilities rather \r\nthan the historical roles of various specialists such as planners, architects, \r\nengineering designers, constructors, fabricators, material suppliers, financial \r\nanalysts and others. To be sure, each specialty has made important advances in \r\ndeveloping new techniques and tools for efficient implementation of construction \r\nprojects. However, it is through the understanding of the entire process of \r\nproject management that these specialists can respond more effectively to the \r\nowner's desires for their services, in marketing their specialties, and in \r\nimproving the productivity and quality of their work. \nThe introduction of innovative and more effective project management for \r\nconstruction is not an academic exercise. As reported by the \"Construction \r\nIndustry Cost Effectiveness Project\" of the Business Roundtable: [1]\n\nBy common consensus and every available measure, the United States no \r\n  longer gets it's money's worth in construction, the nation's largest industry \r\n  ... The creeping erosion of construction efficiency and productivity is bad \r\n  news for the entire U.S. economy. Construction is a particularly seminal \r\n  industry. The price of every factory, office building, hotel or power plant \r\n  that is built affects the price that must be charged for the goods or services \r\n  produced in it or by it. And that effect generally persists for decades ... \r\n  Too much of the industry remains tethered to the past, partly by inertia and \r\n  partly by historic divisions... \nImprovement of project management not only can aid the construction industry, \r\nbut may also be the engine for the national and world economy. However, if we \r\nare to make meaningful improvements, we must first understand the construction \r\nindustry, its operating environment and the institutional constraints affecting \r\nits activities as well as the nature of project management. Back to top\n1.2 The Project Life Cycle\nThe acquisition of a constructed facility usually represents a major capital \r\ninvestment, whether its owner happens to be an individual, a private corporation \r\nor a public agency. Since the commitment of resources for such an investment is \r\nmotivated by market demands or perceived needs, the facility is expected to \r\nsatisfy certain objectives within the constraints specified by the owner and \r\nrelevant regulations. With the exception of the speculative housing market, \r\nwhere the residential units may be sold as built by the real estate developer, \r\nmost constructed facilities are custom made in consultation with the owners. A \r\nreal estate developer may be regarded as the sponsor of building projects, as \r\nmuch as a government agency may be the sponsor of a public project and turns it \r\nover to another government unit upon its completion. From the viewpoint of \r\nproject management, the terms \"owner\" and \"sponsor\" are synonymous because both \r\nhave the ultimate authority to make all important decisions. Since an owner is \r\nessentially acquiring a facility on a promise in some form of agreement, it will \r\nbe wise for any owner to have a clear understanding of the acquisition process \r\nin order to maintain firm control of the quality, timeliness and cost of the \r\ncompleted facility. \nFrom the perspective of an owner, the project life cycle for a constructed \r\nfacility may be illustrated schematically in Figure 1-1. Essentially, a project \r\nis conceived to meet market demands or needs in a timely fashion. Various \r\npossibilities may be considered in the conceptual planning stage, and the \r\ntechnological and economic feasibility of each alternative will be assessed and \r\ncompared in order to select the best possible project. The financing schemes for \r\nthe proposed alternatives must also be examined, and the project will be \r\nprogrammed with respect to the timing for its completion and for available cash \r\nflows. After the scope of the project is clearly defined, detailed engineering \r\ndesign will provide the blueprint for construction, and the definitive cost \r\nestimate will serve as the baseline for cost control. In the procurement and \r\nconstruction stage, the delivery of materials and the erection of the project on \r\nsite must be carefully planned and controlled. After the construction is \r\ncompleted, there is usually a brief period of start-up or shake-down of the \r\nconstructed facility when it is first occupied. Finally, the management of the \r\nfacility is turned over to the owner for full occupancy until the facility lives \r\nout its useful life and is designated for demolition or conversion. \n\n\nFigure 1-1:\u00a0 The Project Life Cycle of a Constructed \r\nFacility\u00a0 \nOf course, the stages of development in Figure 1-1 may not be strictly \r\nsequential. Some of the stages require iteration, and others may be carried out \r\nin parallel or with overlapping time frames, depending on the nature, size and \r\nurgency of the project. Furthermore, an owner may have in-house capacities to \r\nhandle the work in every stage of the entire process, or it may seek \r\nprofessional advice and services for the work in all stages. Understandably, \r\nmost owners choose to handle some of the work in-house and to contract outside \r\nprofessional services for other components of the work as needed. By examining \r\nthe project life cycle from an owner's perspective we can focus on the proper \r\nroles of various activities and participants in all stages regardless of the \r\ncontractual arrangements for different types of work. \nIn the United States, for example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has \r\nin-house capabilities to deal with planning, budgeting, design, construction and \r\noperation of waterway and flood control structures. Other public agencies, such \r\nas state transportation departments, are also deeply involved in all phases of a \r\nconstruction project. In the private sector, many large firms such as DuPont, \r\nExxon, and IBM are adequately staffed to carry out most activities for plant \r\nexpansion. All these owners, both public and private, use outside agents to a \r\ngreater or lesser degree when it becomes more advantageous to do so. \nThe project life cycle may be viewed as a process through which a project is \r\nimplemented from cradle to grave. This process is often very complex; however, \r\nit can be decomposed into several stages as indicated by the general outline in \r\nFigure 1-1. The solutions at various stages are then integrated to obtain the \r\nfinal outcome. Although each stage requires different expertise, it usually \r\nincludes both technical and managerial activities in the knowledge domain \r\nof the specialist. The owner may choose to decompose the entire process into \r\nmore or less stages based on the size and nature of the project, and thus obtain \r\nthe most efficient result in implementation. Very often, the owner retains \r\ndirect control of work in the planning and programming stages, but increasingly \r\noutside planners and financial experts are used as consultants because of the \r\ncomplexities of projects. Since operation and maintenance of a facility will go \r\non long after the completion and acceptance of a project, it is usually treated \r\nas a separate problem except in the consideration of the life cycle cost of a \r\nfacility. All stages from conceptual planning and feasibility studies to the \r\nacceptance of a facility for occupancy may be broadly lumped together and \r\nreferred to as the Design/Construct process, while the procurement and \r\nconstruction alone are traditionally regarded as the province of the \r\nconstruction industry. \nOwners must recognize that there is no single best approach in organizing \r\nproject management throughout a project's life cycle. All organizational \r\napproaches have advantages and disadvantages, depending on the knowledge of the \r\nowner in construction management as well as the type, size and location of the \r\nproject. It is important for the owner to be aware of the approach which is most \r\nappropriate and beneficial for a particular project. In making choices, owners \r\nshould be concerned with the life cycle costs of constructed facilities rather \r\nthan simply the initial construction costs. Saving small amounts of money during \r\nconstruction may not be worthwhile if the result is much larger operating costs \r\nor not meeting the functional requirements for the new facility satisfactorily. \r\nThus, owners must be very concerned with the quality of the finished product as \r\nwell as the cost of construction itself. Since facility operation and \r\nmaintenance is a part of the project life cycle, the owners' expectation to \r\nsatisfy investment objectives during the project life cycle will require \r\nconsideration of the cost of operation and maintenance. Therefore, the \r\nfacility's operating management should also be considered as early as possible, \r\njust as the construction process should be kept in mind at the early stages of \r\nplanning and programming. Back to top\n1.3 Major Types of Construction\nSince most owners are generally interested in acquiring only a specific type \r\nof constructed facility, they should be aware of the common industrial practices \r\nfor the type of construction pertinent to them. Likewise, the construction \r\nindustry is a conglomeration of quite diverse segments and products. Some \r\nowners may procure a constructed facility only once in a long while and tend to \r\nlook for short term advantages. However, many owners require periodic \r\nacquisition of new facilities and/or rehabilitation of existing facilities. It \r\nis to their advantage to keep the construction industry healthy and productive. \r\nCollectively, the owners have more power to influence the construction industry \r\nthan they realize because, by their individual actions, they can provide \r\nincentives or disincentives for innovation, efficiency and quality in \r\nconstruction. It is to the interest of all parties that the owners take an \r\nactive interest in the construction and exercise beneficial influence on the \r\nperformance of the industry. \nIn planning for various types of construction, the methods of procuring \r\nprofessional services, awarding construction contracts, and financing the \r\nconstructed facility can be quite different. For the purpose of discussion, the \r\nbroad spectrum of constructed facilities may be classified into four major \r\ncategories, each with its own characteristics. \nResidential Housing Construction\nResidential housing construction includes single-family houses, multi-family \r\ndwellings, and high-rise apartments. During the development and construction of \r\nsuch projects, the developers or sponsors who are familiar with the construction \r\nindustry usually serve as surrogate owners and take charge, making necessary \r\ncontractual agreements for design and construction, and arranging the financing \r\nand sale of the completed structures. Residential housing designs are usually \r\nperformed by architects and engineers, and the construction executed by builders \r\nwho hire subcontractors for the structural, mechanical, electrical and other \r\nspecialty work. An exception to this pattern is for single-family houses which \r\nmay be designed by the builders as well. \nThe residential housing market is heavily affected by general economic \r\nconditions, tax laws, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the government. \r\nOften, a slight increase in total demand will cause a substantial investment in \r\nconstruction, since many housing projects can be started at different locations \r\nby different individuals and developers at the same time. Because of the \r\nrelative ease of entry, at least at the lower end of the market, many new \r\nbuilders are attracted to the residential housing construction. Hence, this \r\nmarket is highly competitive, with potentially high risks as well as high \r\nrewards. \n\n\nFigure 1-2:\u00a0 Residential Housing Construction (courtesy of \r\nCaterpillar, Inc.)\nInstitutional and Commercial Building Construction\nInstitutional and commercial building construction encompasses a great \r\nvariety of project types and sizes, such as schools and universities, medical \r\nclinics and hospitals, recreational facilities and sports stadiums, retail chain \r\nstores and large shopping centers, warehouses and light manufacturing plants, \r\nand skyscrapers for offices and hotels. The owners of such buildings may or may \r\nnot be familiar with construction industry practices, but they usually are able \r\nto select competent professional consultants and arrange the financing of the \r\nconstructed facilities themselves. Specialty architects and engineers are often \r\nengaged for designing a specific type of building, while the builders or general \r\ncontractors undertaking such projects may also be specialized in only that type \r\nof building. \nBecause of the higher costs and greater sophistication of institutional and \r\ncommercial buildings in comparison with residential housing, this market segment \r\nis shared by fewer competitors. Since the construction of some of these \r\nbuildings is a long process which once started will take some time to proceed \r\nuntil completion, the demand is less sensitive to general economic conditions \r\nthan that for speculative housing. Consequently, the owners may confront an \r\noligopoly of general contractors who compete in the same market. In an \r\noligopoly situation, only a limited number of competitors exist, and a firm's \r\nprice for services may be based in part on its competitive strategies in the \r\nlocal market.\n\n\nFigure 1-3:\u00a0 Construction of the PPG Building in Pittsburgh, \r\nPennsylvania (courtesy of PPG Industries, Inc.)\nSpecialized Industrial Construction\nSpecialized industrial construction usually involves very large scale \r\nprojects with a high degree of technological complexity, such as oil refineries, \r\nsteel mills, chemical processing plants and coal-fired or nuclear power plants. \r\nThe owners usually are deeply involved in the development of a project, and \r\nprefer to work with designers-builders such that the total time for the \r\ncompletion of the project can be shortened. They also want to pick a team of \r\ndesigners and builders with whom the owner has developed good working relations \r\nover the years. \nAlthough the initiation of such projects is also affected by the state of the \r\neconomy, long range demand forecasting is the most important factor since such \r\nprojects are capital intensive and require considerable amount of planning and \r\nconstruction time. Governmental regulation such as the rulings of the \r\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the \r\nUnited States can also profoundly influence decisions on these projects.\n\n\nFigure 1-4:\u00a0 Construction of a Benzene Plant in Lima, Ohio \r\n(courtesy of Manitowoc Company, Inc.)\nInfrastructure and Heavy Construction\nInfrastructure and heavy construction includes projects such as highways, \r\nmass transit systems, tunnels, bridges, pipelines, drainage systems and sewage \r\ntreatment plants. Most of these projects are publicly owned and therefore \r\nfinanced either through bonds or taxes. This category of construction is \r\ncharacterized by a high degree of mechanization, which has gradually replaced \r\nsome labor intensive operations. \nThe engineers and builders engaged in infrastructure construction are usually \r\nhighly specialized since each segment of the market requires different types of \r\nskills. However, demands for different segments of infrastructure and heavy \r\nconstruction may shift with saturation in some segments. For example, as the \r\navailable highway construction projects are declining, some heavy construction \r\ncontractors quickly move their work force and equipment into the field of mining \r\nwhere jobs are available.\n\n\nFigure 1-5:\u00a0 Construction of the Dame Point Bridge in \r\nJacksonville, Florida (courtesy of Mary Lou Maher)Back to top\n1.4 Selection of Professional Services\nWhen an owner decides to seek professional services for the design and \r\nconstruction of a facility, he is confronted with a broad variety of choices. \r\nThe type of services selected depends to a large degree on the type of \r\nconstruction and the experience of the owner in dealing with various \r\nprofessionals in the previous projects undertaken by the firm. Generally, \r\nseveral common types of professional services may be engaged either separately \r\nor in some combination by the owners. \nFinancial Planning Consultants\nAt the early stage of strategic planning for a capital project, an owner \r\noften seeks the services of financial planning consultants such as certified \r\npublic accounting (CPA) firms to evaluate the economic and financial feasibility \r\nof the constructed facility, particularly with respect to various provisions of \r\nfederal, state and local tax laws which may affect the investment decision. \r\nInvestment banks may also be consulted on various options for financing the \r\nfacility in order to analyze their long-term effects on the financial health of \r\nthe owner organization. \nArchitectural and Engineering Firms\nTraditionally, the owner engages an architectural and engineering (A/E) firm \r\nor consortium as technical consultant in developing a preliminary design. After \r\nthe engineering design and financing arrangements for the project are completed, \r\nthe owner will enter into a construction contract with a general contractor \r\neither through competitive bidding or negotiation. The general contractor will \r\nact as a constructor and/or a coordinator of a large number of subcontractors \r\nwho perform various specialties for the completion of the project. The A/E firm \r\ncompletes the design and may also provide on site quality inspection during \r\nconstruction. Thus, the A/E firm acts as the prime professional on behalf of the \r\nowner and supervises the construction to insure satisfactory results. This \r\npractice is most common in building construction. \nIn the past two decades, this traditional approach has become less popular \r\nfor a number of reasons, particularly for large scale projects. The A/E firms, \r\nwhich are engaged by the owner as the prime professionals for design and \r\ninspection, have become more isolated from the construction process. This has \r\noccurred because of pressures to reduce fees to A/E firms, the threat of \r\nlitigation regarding construction defects, and lack of knowledge of new \r\nconstruction techniques on the part of architect and engineering professionals. \r\nInstead of preparing a construction plan along with the design, many A/E firms \r\nare no longer responsible for the details of construction nor do they provide \r\nperiodic field inspection in many cases. As a matter of fact, such firms will \r\nplace a prominent disclaimer of responsibilities on any shop drawings they may \r\ncheck, and they will often regard their representatives in the field as \r\nobservers instead of inspectors. Thus, the A/E firm and the general contractor \r\non a project often become antagonists who are looking after their own competing \r\ninterests. As a result, even the constructibility of some engineering designs \r\nmay become an issue of contention. To carry this protective attitude to the \r\nextreme, the specifications prepared by an A/E firm for the general contractor \r\noften protects the interest of the A/E firm at the expense of the interests of \r\nthe owner and the contractor. \nIn order to reduce the cost of construction, some owners introduce value \r\nengineering, which seeks to reduce the cost of construction by soliciting a \r\nsecond design that might cost less than the original design produced by the A/E \r\nfirm. In practice, the second design is submitted by the contractor after \r\nreceiving a construction contract at a stipulated sum, and the saving in cost \r\nresulting from the redesign is shared by the contractor and the owner. The \r\ncontractor is able to absorb the cost of redesign from the profit in \r\nconstruction or to reduce the construction cost as a result of the re-design. If \r\nthe owner had been willing to pay a higher fee to the A/E firm or to better \r\ndirect the design process, the A/E firm might have produced an improved design \r\nwhich would cost less in the first place. Regardless of the merit of value \r\nengineering, this practice has undermined the role of the A/E firm as the prime \r\nprofessional acting on behalf of the owner to supervise the contractor. \nDesign/Construct Firms\nA common trend in industrial construction, particularly for large projects, \r\nis to engage the services of a design/construct firm. By integrating design and \r\nconstruction management in a single organization, many of the conflicts between \r\ndesigners and constructors might be avoided. In particular, designs will be \r\nclosely scrutinized for their constructibility. However, an owner engaging a \r\ndesign/construct firm must insure that the quality of the constructed facility \r\nis not sacrificed by the desire to reduce the time or the cost for completing \r\nthe project. Also, it is difficult to make use of competitive bidding in this \r\ntype of design/construct process. As a result, owners must be relatively \r\nsophisticated in negotiating realistic and cost-effective construction \r\ncontracts. \nOne of the most obvious advantages of the integrated design/construct process \r\nis the use of phased construction for a large project. In this process, \r\nthe project is divided up into several phases, each of which can be designed and \r\nconstructed in a staggered manner. After the completion of the design of the \r\nfirst phase, construction can begin without waiting for the completion of the \r\ndesign of the second phase, etc. If proper coordination is exercised. the total \r\nproject duration can be greatly reduced. Another advantage is to exploit the \r\npossibility of using the turnkey approach whereby an owner can delegate \r\nall responsibility to the design/construct firm which will deliver to the owner \r\na completed facility that meets the performance specifications at the specified \r\nprice. \nProfessional Construction Managers\nIn recent years, a new breed of construction managers (CM) offers \r\nprofessional services from the inception to the completion of a construction \r\nproject. These construction managers mostly come from the ranks of A/E firms or \r\ngeneral contractors who may or may not retain dual roles in the service of the \r\nowners. In any case, the owner can rely on the service of a single prime \r\nprofessional to manage the entire process of a construction project. However, \r\nlike the A/E firms of several decades ago, the construction managers are \r\nappreciated by some owners but not by others. Before long, some owners find that \r\nthe construction managers too may try to protect their own interest instead of \r\nthat of the owners when the stakes are high. \nIt should be obvious to all involved in the construction process that the \r\nparty which is required to take higher risk demands larger rewards. If an owner \r\nwants to engage an A/E firm on the basis of low fees instead of established \r\nqualifications, it often gets what it deserves; or if the owner wants the \r\ngeneral contractor to bear the cost of uncertainties in construction such as \r\nfoundation conditions, the contract price will be higher even if competitive \r\nbidding is used in reaching a contractual agreement. Without mutual respect and \r\ntrust, an owner cannot expect that construction managers can produce better \r\nresults than other professionals. Hence, an owner must understand its own \r\nresponsibility and the risk it wishes to assign to itself and to other \r\nparticipants in the process. \nOperation and Maintenance Managers\nAlthough many owners keep a permanent staff for the operation and maintenance \r\nof constructed facilities, others may prefer to contract such tasks to \r\nprofessional managers. Understandably, it is common to find in-house staff for \r\noperation and maintenance in specialized industrial plants and infrastructure \r\nfacilities, and the use of outside managers under contracts for the operation \r\nand maintenance of rental properties such as apartments and office buildings. \r\nHowever, there are exceptions to these common practices. For example, \r\nmaintenance of public roadways can be contracted to private firms. In any case, \r\nmanagers can provide a spectrum of operation and maintenance services for a \r\nspecified time period in accordance to the terms of contractual agreements. \r\nThus, the owners can be spared the provision of in-house expertise to operate \r\nand maintain the facilities. \nFacilities Management\nAs a logical extension for obtaining the best services throughout the project \r\nlife cycle of a constructed facility, some owners and developers are receptive \r\nto adding strategic planning at the beginning and facility maintenance as a \r\nfollow-up to reduce space-related costs in their real estate holdings. \r\nConsequently, some architectural/engineering firms and construction management \r\nfirms with computer-based expertise, together with interior design firms, are \r\noffering such front-end and follow-up services in addition to the more \r\ntraditional services in design and construction. This spectrum of services is \r\ndescribed in Engineering News-Record (now ENR) as follows: [2]\n\nFacilities management is the discipline of planning, designing, \r\n  constructing and managing space -- in every type of structure from office \r\n  buildings to process plants. It involves developing corporate facilities \r\n  policy, long-range forecasts, real estate, space inventories, projects \r\n  (through design, construction and renovation), building operation and \r\n  maintenance plans and furniture and equipment inventories. \nA common denominator of all firms entering into these new services is that \r\nthey all have strong computer capabilities and heavy computer investments. In \r\naddition to the use of computers for aiding design and monitoring construction, \r\nthe service includes the compilation of a computer record of building plans that \r\ncan be turned over at the end of construction to the facilities management group \r\nof the owner. A computer data base of facilities information makes it possible \r\nfor planners in the owner's organization to obtain overview information for long \r\nrange space forecasts, while the line managers can use as-built information such \r\nas lease/tenant records, utility costs, etc. for day-to-day operations. Back to top\n1.5 Construction Contractors\nBuilders who supervise the execution of construction projects are \r\ntraditionally referred to as contractors, or more appropriately called \r\nconstructors. The general contractor coordinates various tasks for \r\na project while the specialty contractors such as mechanical or \r\nelectrical contractors perform the work in their specialties. Material and \r\nequipment suppliers often act as installation contractors; they play a \r\nsignificant role in a construction project since the conditions of delivery of \r\nmaterials and equipment affect the quality, cost, and timely completion of the \r\nproject. It is essential to understand the operation of these contractors in \r\norder to deal with them effectively. \nGeneral Contractors\nThe function of a general contractor is to coordinate all tasks in a \r\nconstruction project. Unless the owner performs this function or engages a \r\nprofessional construction manager to do so, a good general contractor who has \r\nworked with a team of superintendents, specialty contractors or subcontractors \r\ntogether for a number of projects in the past can be most effective in inspiring \r\nloyalty and cooperation. The general contractor is also knowledgeable about the \r\nlabor force employed in construction. The labor force may or may not be \r\nunionized depending on the size and location of the projects. In some projects, \r\nno member of the work force belongs to a labor union; in other cases, both union \r\nand non-union craftsmen work together in what is called an open shop, or all \r\ncraftsmen must be affiliated with labor unions in a closed shop. Since labor \r\nunions provide hiring halls staffed with skilled journeyman who have gone \r\nthrough apprentice programs for the projects as well as serving as collective \r\nbargain units, an experienced general contractor will make good use of the \r\nbenefits and avoid the pitfalls in dealing with organized labor. \nSpecialty Contractors\nSpecialty contractors include mechanical, electrical, foundation, excavation, \r\nand demolition contractors among others. They usually serve as subcontractors to \r\nthe general contractor of a project. In some cases, legal statutes may require \r\nan owner to deal with various specialty contractors directly. In the State of \r\nNew York, for example, specialty contractors, such as mechanical and electrical \r\ncontractors, are not subjected to the supervision of the general contractor of a \r\nconstruction project and must be given separate prime contracts on public works. \r\nWith the exception of such special cases, an owner will hold the general \r\ncontractor responsible for negotiating and fulfilling the contractual agreements \r\nwith the subcontractors. \nMaterial and Equipment Suppliers\nMajor material suppliers include specialty contractors in structural steel \r\nfabrication and erection, sheet metal, ready mixed concrete delivery, \r\nreinforcing steel bar detailers, roofing, glazing etc. Major equipment suppliers \r\nfor industrial construction include manufacturers of generators, boilers and \r\npiping and other equipment. Many suppliers handle on-site installation to insure \r\nthat the requirements and contractual specifications are met. As more and larger \r\nstructural units are prefabricated off-site, the distribution between specialty \r\ncontractors and material suppliers becomes even less obvious. Back to top\n1.6 Financing of Constructed Facilities\nA major construction project requires an enormous amount of capital that is \r\noften supplied by lenders who want to be assured that the project will offer a \r\nfair return on the investment. The direct costs associated with a major \r\nconstruction project may be broadly classified into two categories: (1) the \r\nconstruction expenses paid to the general contractor for erecting the facility \r\non site and (2) the expenses for land acquisition, legal fees, \r\narchitect/engineer fees, construction management fees, interest on construction \r\nloans and the opportunity cost of carrying empty space in the facility until it \r\nis fully occupied. The direct construction costs in the first category represent \r\napproximately 60 to 80 percent of the total costs in most construction projects. \r\nSince the costs of construction are ultimately borne by the owner, careful \r\nfinancial planning for the facility must be made prior to construction. \nConstruction Financing\nConstruction loans to contractors are usually provided by banks or savings \r\nand loan associations for construction financing. Upon the completion of the \r\nfacility, construction loans will be terminated and the post-construction \r\nfacility financing will be arranged by the owner. \nConstruction loans provided for different types of construction vary. In the \r\ncase of residential housing, construction loans and long-term mortgages can be \r\nobtained from savings and loans associations or commercial banks. For \r\ninstitutional and commercial buildings, construction loans are usually obtained \r\nfrom commercial banks. Since the value of specialized industrial buildings as \r\ncollateral for loans is limited, construction loans in this domain are rare, and \r\nconstruction financing can be done from the pool of general corporate funds. For \r\ninfrastructure construction owned by government, the property cannot be used as \r\nsecurity for a private loan, but there are many possible ways to finance the \r\nconstruction, such as general appropriation from taxation or special bonds \r\nissued for the project. \nTraditionally, banks serve as construction lenders in a three-party agreement \r\namong the contractor, the owner and the bank. The stipulated loan will be paid \r\nto the contractor on an agreed schedule upon the verification of completion of \r\nvarious portions of the project. Generally, a payment request together with a \r\nstandard progress report will be submitted each month by the contractor to the \r\nowner which in turn submits a draw request to the bank. Provided that the work \r\nto date has been performed satisfactorily, the disbursement is made on that \r\nbasis during the construction period. Under such circumstances, the bank has \r\nbeen primarily concerned with the completion of the facility on time and within \r\nthe budget. The economic life of the facility after its completion is not a \r\nconcern because of the transfer of risk to the owner or an institutional lender. \r\n\nFacility Financing\nMany private corporations maintain a pool of general funds resulting from \r\nretained earnings and long-term borrowing on the strength of corporate assets, \r\nwhich can be used for facility financing. Similarly, for public agencies, the \r\nlong-term funding may be obtained from the commitment of general tax revenues \r\nfrom the federal, state and/or local governments. Both private corporations and \r\npublic agencies may issue special bonds for the constructed facilities which may \r\nobtain lower interest rates than other forms of borrowing. Short-term borrowing \r\nmay also be used for bridging the gaps in long-term financing. Some corporate \r\nbonds are convertible to stocks under circumstances specified in the bond \r\nagreement. For public facilities, the assessment of user fees to repay the bond \r\nfunds merits consideration for certain types of facilities such as toll roads \r\nand sewage treatment plants. [3] The use of mortgages is primarily confined to rental \r\nproperties such as apartments and office buildings. \nBecause of the sudden surge of interest rates in the late 1970's, many \r\nfinancial institutions offer, in addition to the traditional fixed rate \r\nlong-term mortgage commitments, other arrangements such as a combination of debt \r\nand a percentage of ownership in exchange for a long-term mortgage or the use of \r\nadjustable rate mortgages. In some cases, the construction loan may be granted \r\non an open-ended basis without a long-term financing commitment. For example, \r\nthe plan might be issued for the construction period with an option to extend it \r\nfor a period of up to three years in order to give the owner more time to seek \r\nalternative long-term financing on the completed facility. The bank will be \r\ndrawn into situations involving financial risk if it chooses to be a lender \r\nwithout long-term guarantees. \nFor international projects, the currency used for financing agreements \r\nbecomes important.\u00a0 If financial agreements are written in terms of local \r\ncurrencies, then fluctuations in the currency exchange rate can significantly \r\naffect the cost and ultimately profit of a project.\u00a0 In some cases, \r\npayments might also be made in particular commodities such as petroleum or the \r\noutput from the facility itself. \u00a0 Again, these arrangements result in \r\ngreater uncertainty in the financing scheme because the price of these \r\ncommodities may vary. Back to top\n1.7 Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nThe owners of facilities naturally want legal protection for all the \r\nactivities involved in the construction. It is equally obvious that they should \r\nseek competent legal advice. However, there are certain principles that should \r\nbe recognized by owners in order to avoid unnecessary pitfalls. \nLegal Responsibilities\nActivities in construction often involve risks, both physical and financial. \r\nAn owner generally tries to shift the risks to other parties to the degree \r\npossible when entering into contractual agreements with them. However, such \r\naction is not without cost or risk. For example, a contractor who is assigned \r\nthe risks may either ask for a higher contract price to compensate for the \r\nhigher risks, or end up in non-performance or bankruptcy as an act of \r\ndesperation. Such consequences can be avoided if the owner is reasonable in risk \r\nallocation. When risks are allocated to different parties, the owner must \r\nunderstand the implications and spell them out clearly. Sometimes there are \r\nstatutory limitations on the allocation of liabilities among various groups, \r\nsuch as prohibition against the allocation of negligence in design to the \r\ncontractor. An owner must realize its superior power in bargaining and hence the \r\nresponsibilities associated with this power in making contractual agreements. \r\n\nMitigation of Conflicts\nIt is important for the owner to use legal counselors as advisors to mitigate \r\nconflicts before they happen rather than to wield conflicts as weapons against \r\nother parties. There are enough problems in design and construction due to \r\nuncertainty rather than bad intentions. The owner should recognize the more \r\nenlightened approaches for mitigating conflicts, such as using owner-controlled \r\nwrap-up insurance which will provide protection for all parties involved \r\nin the construction process for unforeseen risks, or using arbitration, \r\nmediation and other extra-judicial solutions for disputes among various parties. \r\nHowever, these compromise solutions are not without pitfalls and should be \r\nadopted only on the merit of individual cases. \nGovernment Regulation\nTo protect public safety and welfare, legislatures and various government \r\nagencies periodically issue regulations which influence the construction \r\nprocess, the operation of constructed facilities, and their ultimate disposal. \r\nFor example, building codes promulgated by local authorities have provided \r\nguidelines for design and construction practices for a very long time. Since the \r\n1970's, many federal regulations that are related directly or indirectly to \r\nconstruction have been established in the United States. Among them are safety \r\nstandards for workers issued by the Occupational Health and Safety \r\nAdministration, environmental standards on pollutants and toxic wastes issued by \r\nthe Environmental Protection Agency, and design and operation procedures for \r\nnuclear power plants issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \r\nOwners must be aware of the impacts of these regulations on the costs and \r\ndurations of various types of construction projects as well as possibilities of \r\nlitigation due to various contentions. For example, owners acquiring sites for \r\nnew construction may be strictly liable for any hazardous wastes already on the \r\nsite or removed from the site under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental \r\nResponse Compensation and Liability (CERCL) Act of 1980. For large scale \r\nprojects involving new technologies, the construction costs often escalate with \r\nthe uncertainty associated with such restrictions. Back to top\n1.8 The Changing Environment of the Construction Industry\nThe construction industry is a conglomeration of diverse fields and \r\nparticipants that have been loosely lumped together as a sector of the economy. \r\nThe construction industry plays a central role in national welfare, including \r\nthe development of residential housing, office buildings and industrial plants, \r\nand the restoration of the nation's infrastructure and other public facilities. \r\nThe importance of the construction industry lies in the function of its products \r\nwhich provide the foundation for industrial production, and its impacts on the \r\nnational economy cannot be measured by the value of its output or the number of \r\npersons employed in its activities alone. \nTo be more specific, construction refers to all types of activities usually \r\nassociated with the erection and repair of immobile facilities. Contract \r\nconstruction consists of a large number of firms that perform construction work \r\nfor others, and is estimated to be approximately 85% of all construction \r\nactivities. The remaining 15% of construction is performed by owners of the \r\nfacilities, and is referred to as force-account construction. Although \r\nthe number of contractors in the United States exceeds a million, over 60% of \r\nall contractor construction is performed by the top 400 contractors. The value \r\nof new construction in the United States (expressed in constant dollars) and the \r\nvalue of construction as a percentage of the gross national products from 1950 \r\nto 1985 are shown in Figures 1-6 and 1-7. It can be seen that construction is a \r\nsignificant factor in the Gross National Product although its importance has \r\nbeen declining in recent years. [4] Not to be ignored is the fact that as the nation's \r\nconstructed facilities become older, the total expenditure on rehabilitation and \r\nmaintenance may increase relative to the value of new construction.\n\n\nFigure 1-6:\u00a0 Value of New Construction in the United States, \r\n1975-1995\n\n\nFigure 1-7:\u00a0 Construction as Percentage of Gross Domestic Product \r\nin the United States, 1975-1995\nOwners who pay close attention to the peculiar characteristics of the \r\nconstruction industry and its changing operating environment will be able to \r\ntake advantage of the favorable conditions and to avoid the pitfalls. Several \r\nfactors are particularly noteworthy because of their significant impacts on the \r\nquality, cost and time of construction. \nNew Technologies\nIn recent years, technological innovation in design, materials and \r\nconstruction methods have resulted in significant changes in construction costs. \r\nComputer-aids have improved capabilities for generating quality designs as well \r\nas reducing the time required to produce alternative designs. New materials not \r\nonly have enhanced the quality of construction but also have shortened the time \r\nfor shop fabrication and field erection. Construction methods have gone through \r\nvarious stages of mechanization and automation, including the latest development \r\nof construction robotics. \nThe most dramatic new technology applied to construction has been the \r\nInternet and its private, corporate Intranet versions. The Internet is widely \r\nused as a means to foster collaboration among professionals on a project, to \r\ncommunicate for bids and results, and to procure necessary goods and services. \r\nReal time video from specific construction sites is widely used to illustrate \r\nconstruction progress to interested parties. The result has been more effective \r\ncollaboration, communication and procurement. \nThe effects of many new technologies on construction costs have been mixed \r\nbecause of the high development costs for new technologies. However, it is \r\nunmistakable that design professionals and construction contractors who have not \r\nadapted to changing technologies have been forced out of the mainstream of \r\ndesign and construction activities. Ultimately, construction quality and cost \r\ncan be improved with the adoption of new technologies which are proved to be \r\nefficient from both the viewpoints of performance and economy. \nLabor Productivity\nThe term productivity is generally defined as a ratio of the \r\nproduction output volume to the input volume of resources. Since both output and \r\ninput can be quantified in a number of ways, there is no single measure of \r\nproductivity that is universally applicable, particularly in the construction \r\nindustry where the products are often unique and there is no standard for \r\nspecifying the levels for aggregation of data. However, since labor constitutes \r\na large part of the cost of construction, labor productivity in terms of output \r\nvolume (constant dollar value or functional units) per person-hour is a useful \r\nmeasure. Labor productivity measured in this way does not necessarily indicate \r\nthe efficiency of labor alone but rather measures the combined effects of labor, \r\nequipment and other factors contributing to the output. \nWhile aggregate construction industry productivity is important as a measure \r\nof national economy, owners are more concerned about the labor productivity of \r\nbasic units of work produced by various crafts on site. Thus, an owner can \r\ncompare the labor performance at different geographic locations, under different \r\nworking conditions, and for different types and sizes of projects. \nConstruction costs usually run parallel to material prices and labor wages. \r\nActually, over the years, labor productivity has increased in some traditional \r\ntypes of construction and thus provides a leveling or compensating effect when \r\nhourly rates for labor increase faster than other costs in construction. \r\nHowever, labor productivity has been stagnant or even declined in unconventional \r\nor large scale projects. \nPublic Scrutiny\nUnder the present litigious climate in the United States, the public is \r\nincreasingly vocal in the scrutiny of construction project activities. Sometimes \r\nit may result in considerable difficulty in siting new facilities as well as \r\nadditional expenses during the construction process itself. Owners must be \r\nprepared to manage such crises before they get out of control. \nFigure 1-8 can serve to indicate public attitudes towards the siting of new \r\nfacilities. It represents the cumulative percentage of individuals who would be \r\nwilling to accept a new industrial facility at various distances from their \r\nhomes. For example, over fifty percent of the people surveyed would accept a \r\nten-story office building within five miles of their home, but only twenty-five \r\npercent would accept a large factory or coal fired power plant at a similar \r\ndistance. An even lower percentage would accept a hazardous waste disposal site \r\nor a nuclear power plant. Even at a distance of one hundred miles, a significant \r\nfraction of the public would be unwilling to accept hazardous waste facilities \r\nor nuclear power plants. \n\n\nFigure 1-8:\u00a0 Public Acceptance Towards New Facilities (Reprinted \r\nfrom Environmental Quality - 1980, the Eleventh Annual Report of the \r\nCouncil on Environmental Quality, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, \r\nDC, December 1980.)\nThis objection to new facilities is a widespread public attitude, \r\nrepresenting considerable skepticism about the external benefits and costs which \r\nnew facilities will impose. It is this public attitude which is likely to make \r\npublic scrutiny and regulation a continuing concern for the construction \r\nindustry. \nInternational Competition\nA final trend which deserves note is the increasing level of international \r\ncompetition in the construction industry. Owners are likely to find \r\nnon-traditional firms bidding for construction work, particularly on large \r\nprojects. Separate bids from numerous European, North American, and Asian \r\nconstruction firms are not unusual. In the United States, overseas firms are \r\nbecoming increasingly visible and important. In this environment of heightened \r\ncompetition, good project management and improved productivity are more and more \r\nimportant. \nA bidding competition for a major new offshore drilling platform illustrates \r\nthe competitive environment in construction. As described in the Wall Street \r\nJournal: [5]\n\nThrough most of the postwar years, the nation's biggest builders of \r\n  offshore oil platforms enjoyed an unusually cozy relationship with the Big Oil \r\n  Companies they served. Their top officials developed personal friendships with \r\n  oil executives, entertained them at opulent hunting camps- and won contracts \r\n  to build nearly every major offshore oil platform in the world....But this \r\n  summer, the good-old boy network fell apart. Shell [Oil Co.] awarded the main \r\n  contract for [a new] platform - taller than Chicago's Sears Tower, four times \r\n  heavier than the Brooklyn Bridge - to a tiny upstart. \nThe winning bidder arranged overseas fabrication of the rig, kept overhead \r\ncosts low, and proposed a novel assembly procedure by which construction \r\nequipment was mounted on completed sections of the platform in order to speed \r\nthe completion of the entire structure. The result was lower costs than those \r\nestimated and bid by traditional firms. \nOf course, U.S. firms including A/E firms, contractors and construction \r\nmanagers are also competing in foreign countries. Their success or failure in \r\nthe international arena may also affect their capacities and vitality to provide \r\nservices in the domestic U.S. market. \nContractor Financed Projects\nIncreasingly, some owners look to contractors or joint ventures as a resource \r\nto design, to build and to finance a constructed facility. For example, a \r\nutility company may seek a consortium consisting of a design/construct firm and \r\na financial investment firm to assume total liability during construction and \r\nthereby eliminate the risks of cost escalation to ratepayers, stockholders and \r\nthe management. On the other hand, a local sanitation district may seek such a \r\nconsortium to provide private ownership for a proposed new sewage treatment \r\nplant. In the former case, the owner may take over the completed facility and \r\nservice the debt on construction through long-term financing arrangements; in \r\nthe latter case, the private owner may operate the completed facility and \r\nrecover its investment through user fees. The activities of joint ventures among \r\ndesign, construction and investment firms are sometimes referred to as \r\nfinancial engineering. \nThis type of joint venture has become more important in the international \r\nconstruction market where aggressive contractors often win contracts by offering \r\na more attractive financing package rather than superior technology. With a \r\ndeepening shadow of international debts in recent years, many developing \r\ncountries are not in a position to undertake any new project without \r\ncontractor-backed financing. Thus, the contractors or joint ventures in overseas \r\nprojects are forced into very risky positions if they intend to stay in the \r\ncompetition. \nLean Construction\n\"Lean manufacturing\" had a revolutionary effect on many industries, especially\r\nautomotive assembly companies.  Characteristics of this approach include:\r\nImprovement in quality and reduction of waste everywhere.  Rather than\r\nincreasing costs, reducing defects and waste proved to improve quality and reduce costs.\r\nEmpowering workers to be responsible for satisfying customer needs.  In construction, \r\nfor example, craftsman should make sure their work satisfied the design\r\nintent.\r\nContinuous improvement of processes involving the entire workforce.\r\nLean construction is intended to spread these practices within the construction industry.  \r\nOf course, well managed construction projects already have many aspects of lean construction.\r\nFor example, just-in-time delivery of materials is commonplace to avoid the waste\r\nof large inventory stockpiles.  Green building projects attempt to re-use or recycle\r\nall construction wastes.  But the systematic attention to continuous improvement and \r\nzero accidents and defects is new.\r\n\r\nBack to top\n1.9 The Role of Project Managers\nIn the project life cycle, the most influential factors affecting the outcome \r\nof the project often reside at the early stages. At this point, decisions should \r\nbe based on competent economic evaluation with due consideration for adequate \r\nfinancing, the prevalent social and regulatory environment, and technological \r\nconsiderations. Architects and engineers might specialize in planning, in \r\nconstruction field management, or in operation, but as project managers, they \r\nmust have some familiarity with all such aspects in order to understand properly \r\ntheir role and be able to make competent decisions. \nSince the 1970's, many large-scale projects have run into serious problems of \r\nmanagement, such as cost overruns and long schedule delays. Actually, the \r\nmanagement of megaprojects or superprojects is not a practice \r\npeculiar to our time. Witness the construction of transcontinental railroads in \r\nthe Civil War era and the construction of the Panama Canal at the turn of this \r\ncentury. Although the megaprojects of this generation may appear in greater \r\nfrequency and present a new set of challenge, the problems are organizational \r\nrather than technical. As noted by Hardy Cross: [6]\n\nIt is customary to think of engineering as a part of a trilogy, pure \r\n  science, applied science and engineering. It needs emphasis that this trilogy \r\n  is only one of a triad of trilogies into which engineering fits. This first is \r\n  pure science, applied science and engineering; the second is economic theory, \r\n  finance and engineering; and the third is social relations, industrial \r\n  relations and engineering. Many engineering problems are as closely allied to \r\n  social problems as they are to pure science. \nAs engineers advance professionally, they often spend as much or more time on \r\nplanning, management and other economic or social problems as on the traditional \r\nengineering design and analysis problems which form the core of most educational \r\nprograms. It is upon the ability of engineers to tackle all such problems that \r\ntheir performance will ultimately be judged. \nThe greatest stumbling block to effective management in construction is the \r\ninertia and historic divisions among planners, designers and constructors. While \r\ntechnical competence in design and innovation remains the foundation of \r\nengineering practice, the social, economic and organizational factors that are \r\npervasive in influencing the success and failure of construction projects must \r\nalso be dealt with effectively by design and construction organizations. Of \r\ncourse, engineers are not expected to know every detail of management \r\ntechniques, but they must be knowledgeable enough to anticipate the problems of \r\nmanagement so that they can work harmoniously with professionals in related \r\nfields to overcome the inertia and historic divisions. \nParadoxically, engineers who are creative in engineering design are often \r\ninnovative in planning and management since both types of activities involve \r\nproblem solving. In fact, they can reinforce each other if both are included in \r\nthe education process, provided that creativity and innovation instead of \r\nroutine practice are emphasized. A project manager who is well educated in the \r\nfundamental principles of engineering design and management can usefully \r\napply such principles once he or she has acquired basic understanding of a new \r\napplication area. A project manager who has been trained by rote learning \r\nfor a specific type of project may merely gain one year of experience repeated \r\ntwenty times even if he or she has been in the field for twenty years. A broadly \r\neducated project manager can reasonably hope to become a leader in the \r\nprofession; a narrowly trained project manager is often relegated to the role of \r\nhis or her first job level permanently. \nThe owners have much at stake in selecting a competent project manager and in \r\nproviding her or him with the authority to assume responsibility at various \r\nstages of the project regardless of the types of contractual agreements for \r\nimplementing the project. Of course, the project manager must also possess the \r\nleadership quality and the ability to handle effectively intricate interpersonal \r\nrelationships within an organization. The ultimate test of the education and \r\nexperience of a project manager for construction lies in her or his ability to \r\napply fundamental principles to solving problems in the new and unfamiliar \r\nsituations which have become the hallmarks of the changing environment in the \r\nconstruction industry.

Later in 2001, the Agile Manifesto, a \"formal proclamation of four key values and 12 principles to guide an iterative and people-centric approach to software development,\" was published by 17 software developers.

The following table shows adoption rates of the agile methodology in a variety of leading industries, as shown in the 11th Annual State of Agile survey by Version One.\n\n\n\n\nIndustry\nAgile adoption rate\n\n\n\n\nSoftware (ISV)\n23 percent\n\n\nFinancial services\n14 percent\n\n\nProfessional services\n12 percent\n\n\nInsurance\n6 percent\n\n\nHealthcare\n6 percent\n\n\nGovernment\n5 percent\n\n\nTelecoms\n4 percent\n\n\nTransportation\n4 percent\n\n\nManufacturing\n4 percent\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of agileAgile was originally developed for the software industry to streamline and improve the development process in an effort to rapidly identify and adjust for issues and defects. It provides a way for developers and teams to deliver a better product, in a faster manner, through short, iterative, interactive sessions/sprints. In the era of digital transformation, with many companies migrating to a digital workplace, agile is a perfect fit for organizations looking to transform how they manage projects and operate as a whole. Agile can help ensure company-wide process and methodological alignment. In terms of business benefits, both the digital workplace and agile provide:\nIncreased flexibility\nIncreased productivity\nIncreased transparency\nHigher quality deliverables\nDecreased risk of missed objectives\nIncreased stakeholder engagement and satisfaction\nAdvantages of agile for project managementIn the project management field, agile provides project teams, sponsors, project leaders and customers many project-specific benefits, including: \nMore rapid deployment of solutions\nReduced waste through minimization of resources\nIncreased flexibility and adaptability to change\nIncreased success through more focused efforts\nFaster turnaround times\nFaster detection of issues and defects\nOptimized development processes\nA lighter weight framework\nOptimal project control\nIncreased focus on specific customer needs\nIncreased frequency of collaboration and feedback\nThe drawbacks of agileAs with any other methodology, agile is not well-suited for every project, and sufficient due diligence is always recommended to identify the best methodology for each unique situation. Agile may not work as intended if a customer is not clear on goals, the project manager or team is inexperienced, or if they do not function well under significant pressure. Throughout the development process, agile favors the developers, project teams and customer goals, but not necessarily the end user's experience. Due to its less formal and more flexible processes, agile may not always be easily absorbed within larger more traditional organizations where there are significant amounts of rigidity or flexibility within processes, policies, or teams. It may also face problems being used with customers who similarly have rigid processes or operating methods.\nCombining agile with other methodologiesThe opportunity exists to combine agile with other methodologies such as waterfall to create a hybrid solution. Companies sometimes use waterfall to handle one or more phases \u2014 such as planning \u2014 where these do not require rapid or repetitive steps. Planning in particular requires a more comprehensive, methodical, often slower approach to defining, analyzing, and documenting aspects of a project. This makes waterfall a better approach. Once a project enters the development phase, rapid and repetitive changes require a different approach and this is where agile kicks in to deliver the best results in the shortest amount of time. This hybrid approach aids in making agile even more adaptable within various industries or to suit the more unique nature of a project, product, or service.\u00a0 Again, due diligence is required to determine the suitability and capacity of the different methods and processes available.Popular agile methodologiesWithin agile there are some frequently used or popular methods, with Scrum, Kanban, and Lean being the most popular. Some agile methods include:\nScrum\nKanban\nLean (LN)\nDynamic System Development Model, (DSDM)\nExtreme Programming (XP)\nCrystal\nAdaptive software development (ASD)\nAgile Unified Process (AUP)\nCrystal Clear methods\nDisciplined agile delivery\nFeature-driven development (FDD)\nScrumban\nRAD(Rapid Application Development)\nTo find out which methodology is right for your project or organization, see \"Comparing agile project management frameworks.\"Agile project management and ScrumScrum is a powerful framework for implementing agile processes in software development and other projects. This highly adopted framework utilizes short iterations of work, called sprints, and daily meetings, called scrums, to tackle discrete portions of a project in succession until the project as a whole is complete. There are three key roles within Scrum: the Scrum master, product owner, and Scrum team members: \nThe product owner creates and prioritizes a product backlog (work to be done).\nTeams select items from the backlog and determine how to complete the work.\nWork must be completed within a sprint (usually two to four weeks).\nThe Scrum master meets with teams briefly each day to get progress updates.\nSprint reviews are conducted at the end of each sprint.\nThe process starts again until all work or backlog is complete.\nSee also \"What is a Scrum master? A key role for project success.\"Organizational hurdles to adopting agileOrganizations looking to adopt agile for project management my encounter any of a number of common hurdles, such as the following:\nA company structure or culture that does not adequately support agile: Although project teams may be ready for agile development, the rest of the company may not be on board. Sponsors, executives, and functional leaders must also buy into and support agile for it to be truly effective.\nUnclear understanding of the impact to the overall business goals: Simply executing projects using agile methodology isn\u2019t enough to reap the desired benefits. Projects can still be executed in ways that don\u2019t provide the entire business with the results that help achieve sustainable growth. Strategic alignment is still critical.\nRushed testing cycles: Sprints can create a risk of rushed testing cycles. In the process of trying to get through sprints as quickly as possible, teams can become more focused on the timeline and miss simple aspects of the testing cycle, which can have potential significant repercussions. Defects can go undetected or are detected too late.\nLimited agile skill: Although agile is rapidly taking root, top agile talent can be hard to find and attract. Limited agile talent means limited benefits for companies wanting to execute projects using this methodology.\nFor a deeper look at how to make the shift, see \"Agile project management: 16 tips for a smooth switch to agile.\"For insights into how organizations go wrong with agile, see \"7 simple ways to fail at agile\" and \"5 misconceptions CIOs still have about agile.\"Key agile skillsThere are six key agile project management skills or attributes that all project managers should have:\nAn ability to cut through unnecessary work and focus only on essential work\nSound judgment under pressure and the ability to remain calm under stress\nStrong motivation and coaching skill to guide and support teams throughout a project\nExceptional organizational abilities to keep everything straight and prioritize\nThe ability to think and make decisions quickly as circumstances change rapidly\nA high level of adaptability in order to accept change and reduce unnecessary confusion and risk\nAgile project management certification and trainingAs agile methodology picks up speed, so does the demand for professionals with agile knowledge and experience. Here are seven agile-focused certifications to provide a benchmark for your knowledge.\nPMI-ACP\nAPMG International\nStrategyex Certificate (Associate or Master\u2019s) in agile\nInternational Consortium for Agile (ICAgile)\nAgile Certification Institute\nScaled Agile Academy\nScrum Alliance\nFor a more in-depth look at these certs, see \u201c7 agile certifications to take your career to the next level.\u201dAgile project management softwareCompanies using agile are likely to leverage software geared to agile development in order to get the full benefits of this methodology.

Here are just a few among several others available from Microsoft:\u00a0\nAgile glossary\nAgile process guides\nAgile process work item types and workflow\nBacklogs\nScrum process\nScrum process work item types and workflow\nUse agile in Microsoft Project\nAgile project management software vendors also typically have built-in agile templates in their software.The future of agileAs competition is continually increasing and time to market is also shrinking, agile offers numerous benefits and limited drawbacks. As more companies make the shift to a digital workplace that is highly dependent on speed, flexibility and increased productivity, agile or hybrid methodologies will become increasingly necessary. Its application in multiple industries and alignment with the benefits offered by a digital workplace model, indicate that agile adoption rates will continue to increase across industries around the world.\nMore on agile project management:\n\n Agile project management: 16 tips for a smooth switch to agile \n Scrum vs. Lean vs. Kanban: Comparing agile project management frameworks \n Agile KPIs: How to measure agile success \n Moving agile beyond IT: The secret to successful software delivery \n 8 agile certifications to take your career to the next level \n 7 simple ways to fail at agile \n Agile\u2019s dark secret?
